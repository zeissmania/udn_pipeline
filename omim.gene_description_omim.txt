**Intellectual developmental disorder and retinitis pigmentosa, 618195 (3), AR**
Intellectual developmental disorder and retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability and typical features of RP. Patients experience reduced night vision, constriction of visual fields, and reduced visual acuity; optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal blood vessels, and bone-spicule pigmentation are seen on funduscopy. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is observed in some patients (Tatour et al., 2017).
Tatour et al. (2017) studied 4 patients from 3 unrelated families with intellectual developmental disorder and retinitis pigmentosa. Mild to moderate intellectual disability was noted in childhood, and 3 of the patients were also diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Reduced night vision developed in the second and third decades of life, at which time visual acuity was moderately to severely reduced, with concentric constriction of visual fields. Funduscopy revealed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal blood vessels, and bone-spicule pigmentation. At ages 14 and 15 years, full-field electroretinograms were nonrecordable in 2 affected sisters (family A), reflecting reduced function of the entire retina. However, flash visual evoked potentials were normal in the older sister but abnormal in the younger sister, indicating more advanced degenerative disease involving the central retina in the latter patient. An unrelated affected woman (family B) showed more severe intellectual disability than the 2 sisters, and also exhibited bilateral subcapsular posterior cataracts and alopecia areata. The authors stated that additional genetic and/or environmental factors might be responsible for the observed interindividual and intrafamilial variability in severity of RP and intellectual disability; however, they suggested that the alopecia areata was coincidental. All 4 patients had normal hearing and showed no dysmorphic features; brain imaging, which was performed in 2 of the patients, was normal or nondiagnostic.



SHANK3
**Phelan-McDermid syndrome, 606232 (3), AD**
Phelan-McDermid syndrome is a developmental disorder with variable features. Common features include neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, normal to accelerated growth, absent to severely delayed speech, autistic behavior (see 209850), and minor dysmorphic features (Precht et al., 1998; Prasad et al., 2000; Durand et al., 2007).
Phelan et al. (2001) compared the phenotypes of 37 patients with 22q13 deletion syndrome with those of 24 published cases. All 37 patients presented with global developmental delay and absent or severely delayed expressive speech. Hypotonia was present in 97% of patients, and 95% showed normal to accelerated growth. Other less common features associated with this syndrome included increased tolerance to pain, dysplastic toenails, chewing behavior, fleshy hands, dysplastic ears, pointed chin, dolichocephaly, ptosis, tendency to overheat, and epicanthic folds.
Bonaglia et al. (2001) studied a 4.5-year-old boy with all the features of terminal 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. He had only slight delay in early motor milestones and severely compromised language development, in that he was unable to utter single words until he was 2 years old. At age 4.5 years, his verbal expression was limited to a few words. The boy had mild mental retardation (overall IQ of 54) and sharply limited verbal abilities (verbal IQ of 32 and performance IQ of 70). Neurologic examination showed mild hypotonia and minor dysmorphic features (dolichocephaly, epicanthic folds, and saddle nose with bulbous tip).
Wilson et al. (2003) noted that very few organ malformations had been reported in patients with 22q13 deletion syndrome.
Lindquist et al. (2005) reported the clinical features of 6 cases of 22q13 deletion in Denmark. Consistent phenotypic features were generalized developmental delay, hypotonia, compromised language development, normal or accelerated growth, and minor facial dysmorphisms. Other features included partial absence of corpus callosum, bilateral ureteropelvic structure, gastroesophageal reflux, and hearing loss.
Tabolacci et al. (2005) reported 2 brothers, born of nonconsanguineous parents, who had moderate to severe mental retardation, severe macrocephaly, obesity, big hands and feet, advanced bone age, and brain abnormalities, including frontal cortical atrophy. The height of both brothers, aged 24 and 15 years, respectively, was at the 10th centile, below the midparental target. They both exhibited autistic-like behavior in which they would stand still for several minutes with a fixed facial expression in an almost catatonic state; the parents also reported that they had a high pain threshold. FISH screening revealed a cryptic subtelomeric deletion of chromosome region 22q13 not present in either parent; segregation analysis showed the deletion to be of maternal origin, mostly likely due to germinal mosaicism. Tabolacci et al. (2005) noted similarities to Clark-Baraitser syndrome (617752).
Soorya et al. (2013) reported a serially ascertained sample of 32 patients with SHANK3 deletion or mutation who were evaluated by a team of child psychiatrists, neurologists, clinical geneticists, molecular geneticists, and psychologists. Patients were evaluated for autism spectrum disorder using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G (ADOS-G). Thirty participants had 22q13.3 deletions ranging from 101 kb to 8.45 Mb, and 2 participants had de novo SHANK3 point mutations. The sample was characterized by high rates of autism spectrum disorder: 27 (84%) met criteria for autism spectrum disorder and 24 (75%) for autistic disorder. Most patients (77%) exhibited severe to profound intellectual disability, and only 5 (19%) used some words spontaneously to communicate. Dysmorphic features, hypotonia, gait disturbance, recurring upper respiratory tract infections, gastroesophageal reflux, and seizures were also common. Larger deletions were associated with increased levels of dysmorphic features, medical comorbidities, and social communication impairments related to autism. Analyses of individuals with small deletions or point mutations identified features related to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, including ASD, seizures and abnormal EEG, hypotonia, sleep disturbances, abnormal brain MRI, gastroesophageal reflux, and certain dysmorphic features. In this study of 32 patients, 53% had large, fleshy hands; 47% had a bulbous nose; 44% had long eyelashes; 41% had ear anomalies; 34% had hypoplastic or dysplastic toenails; 31% had full lips, epicanthal folds, or macrocephaly; 25% had dolichocephaly, high arched palate, hyperextensibility, full cheeks, or periorbital fullness; and 22% had a pointed chin or abnormal spinal curvature. A smaller minority had other dysmorphic features. In terms of medical comorbidities, 88% had increased pain tolerance; 75% had hypotonia; 53% had recurring upper respiratory tract infections; 44% had gastroesophageal reflux; 41% had sleep disturbances or either febrile or nonfebrile seizures; and 38% had constipation and/or diarrhea or renal abnormalities. A smaller minority had other comorbidities.
Disciglio et al. (2014) reported 9 patients with features of Phelan-McDermid syndrome associated with interstitial deletions of chromosome 22q13 that did not include the SHANK3 gene. Clinical features included developmental delay, speech delay, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. In addition, the majority of patients had macrocephaly.
**{Schizophrenia 15}, 613950 (3), AD**
Gauthier et al. (2010) identified a family in which a proband and 2 affected brothers had schizophrenia. The proband was of European ancestry and had a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder at age 19. He suffered from borderline mental retardation, with an IQ of 73, and had no autistic features. His brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 21 and had a history of hyperactivity in childhood and 1 seizure at age 10. He was described as having mild mental retardation, but no definitive IQ was available. The third brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and atypical chronic psychosis at age 16. He had moderate mental retardation, with an IQ of 36. The 3 brothers had no evidence of dysmorphic features, and no psychiatric illness was known to be present in the extended family except for major depression in the mother. An individual from a second family, a 23-year-old woman of European ancestry, was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at age 11 years. She had normal growth and no evidence of dysmorphic features but had speech impairment and poor academic and social performance with an IQ of 73. She had no evidence of autism on formal testing.



GBE1
**Glycogen storage disease IV, 232500 (3), AR**
Glycogen storage disease type IV is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. The typical 'classic' hepatic presentation is liver disease of childhood, progressing to lethal cirrhosis. The neuromuscular presentation of GSD IV is distinguished by age at onset into 4 groups: perinatal, presenting as fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) and perinatal death; congenital, with hypotonia, neuronal involvement, and death in early infancy; childhood, with myopathy or cardiomyopathy; and adult, with isolated myopathy or adult polyglucosan body disease (Bruno et al., 2004). The enzyme deficiency results in tissue accumulation of abnormal glycogen with fewer branching points and longer outer branches, resembling an amylopectin-like structure, also known as polyglucosan (Tay et al., 2004).
Bruno et al. (2007) provided a review of the neuromuscular forms of glycogen branching enzyme deficiency.
Classic Hepatic Form
Andersen (1956) originally reported GSD IV as 'familial cirrhosis of the liver with storage of abnormal glycogen.' Brown and Brown (1966) determined that the defect in GSD IV was a deficiency of the alpha-1,4-glucan branching enzyme.
Bao et al. (1996) noted that the most common form of GSD IV presents in the first 18 months of life with failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and liver cirrhosis. There is progression to portal hypertension, ascites, and liver failure, leading to death by age 5 years. A simple iodine test shows formation of a blue colored complex of glycogen and iodine. The liver shows the main involvement, resulting from a defect of amylo(1,4 to 1,6) transglucosidase (brancher enzyme).
Nonprogressive Hepatic Form
Less frequently, patients may have liver dysfunction without liver failure, referred to as 'nonprogressive hepatic GSD IV.' Greene et al. (1988) reported a 5-year-old boy who was first noted to have elevated serum transaminase levels and hepatomegaly at age 2 years following an acute febrile illness. Successive liver biopsies showed hepatocellular periodic-acid Schiff-positive diastase-resistant inclusions and hepatic fibrosis that was nonprogressive over 3 years. Enzymatic assays showed deficient branching enzyme in liver, skeletal muscle, and skin fibroblasts. The child showed normal growth and development.
McConkie-Rosell et al. (1996) found that 6 patients with nonprogressive hepatic GSD IV did not develop progressive liver cirrhosis, cardiac, or neurologic involvement, despite residual branching enzyme activity in skin fibroblasts that was indistinguishable from patients with more severe forms of GSD IV. The authors concluded that residual enzyme activity could not be used to predict the clinical course in GSD IV, that not all patients require liver transplant, and that caution should be used in genetic counseling.
Fatal Perinatal Neuromuscular Form
Alegria et al. (1999) reported hydrops fetalis as a presenting manifestation of glycogen storage disease type IV. The infant, delivered by cesarean section at 34 weeks, had generalized edema, severe hypotonia, and arthrogryposis of the lower limbs at birth. There were no signs of cirrhosis or liver failure. She died on the fourth day of life.
Cox et al. (1999) reported 3 sib fetuses who were shown to have type IV glycogen storage disease by pathologic and biochemical studies, with onset of hydrops, limb contractures, and akinesia in the early second trimester.
Congenital Neuromuscular Form
Zellweger et al. (1972) reported infantile onset of GSD IV with hypotonia.
McMaster et al. (1979) reported a 30-month old girl with GSD IV in whom extensive involvement of the nervous system was found at autopsy. In a review of the literature, the authors noted that approximately 50% of GSD IV patients have neuromuscular signs and symptoms.
Tang et al. (1994) reported a neonate with GSD IV who presented with severe hypotonia and dilated cardiomyopathy. The classic clinical manifestation of liver cirrhosis was not present, although amylopectin-like inclusions were found in hepatocytes. He died of cardiorespiratory failure at 4 weeks of age. In the child reported by Tang et al. (1994), Bao et al. (1996) identified a mutation in the GBE1 gene (607839.0001).
Tay et al. (2004) reported 2 unrelated patients with the congenital variant of GSD IV confirmed by mutation in the GBE1 gene (607839.0008). Both pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios, and both neonates showed hypotonia and poor respiratory effort at birth. Only 1 had contractures. Both died within the first weeks of life. Branching enzyme activities were 0.9% and 0.8% of normal controls. Postmortem examination of 1 infant showed pale, atrophic skeletal muscles, and PAS-positive, diastase-resistant globules in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and neurons of the brain and spinal cord.
Bruno et al. (2004) reported 2 sibs with congenital GSD IV confirmed by mutation in the GBE1 gene (607839.0011; 607839.0012). In both cases, pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios, reduced fetal movements, and fetal hydrops. At birth, both infants had severe hypotonia, hyporeflexia, and no spontaneous respiration. Death occurred at ages 4 months and 4 weeks, respectively, due to cardiorespiratory failure. Autopsy showed hypertrophy of the left cardiac ventricle. Residual GBE1 activity in fibroblasts was less than 5%.
Assereto et al. (2007) reported 2 unrelated newborns who showed severe hypotonia at birth and died of cardiorespiratory failure at ages 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Both pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios and reduced fetal movements. One infant had equinovarus feet with flexion contractures. GBE1 activity in cultured fibroblasts was less than 5% in both cases. Molecular analysis identified a homozygous null mutation in the GBE1 gene in each patient (607839.0017 and 607839.0018, respectively).
Childhood Neuromuscular Form
Guerra et al. (1986) reported an 8-year-old child with Andersen syndrome. Servidei et al. (1987) reported a 7.5-year-old girl with exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea. She developed congestive heart failure and died 1 year later. Endomyocardial biopsy showed abundant PAS-positive, diastase-resistant cytoplasmic deposits that were also seen in muscle, skin, and liver specimens. Glycogen branching enzyme was absent in all postmortem tissues.
In 3 Turkish male sibs suffering from chronic progressive myopathy, Reusche et al. (1992) identified a mild juvenile form of type IV glycogenosis which was confirmed by the finding of profound deficiency of the brancher enzyme. They pointed out that when polyglucosan inclusions are observed in myofibers, it is mandatory to examine muscle tissue for brancher enzyme activity since this enzyme activity was normal in circulating erythrocytes and leukocytes in all 3 affected sibs and their parents; the disorder in this family was limited to muscle tissues.
Schroder et al. (1993) reported a case of juvenile type IV glycogenosis with total branching enzyme deficiency in skeletal muscle and liver tissue in a male who presented with severe myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, dysmorphic features, and subclinical neuropathy. He died from sudden cardiac death at age 19. His 15-year-old brother had similar clinical and histologic findings.
Bruno et al. (2004) reported a 4-year-old boy with childhood neuromuscular GSD IV confirmed by mutation in the GBE1 gene (607839.0006; 607839.0013). He developed generalized hypotonia at age 11 months; at age 3 years, he had myopathic face, muscular hypotrophy and hypotonia, and waddling gait with hyperlordosis. Serum creatine kinase was normal, and there were no signs of liver involvement. Residual GBE1 activity in fibroblasts was 15 to 25%.
Adult Neuromuscular Form with Isolated Myopathy
Ferguson et al. (1983) presented the case of a 59-year-old man with a 30-year history of a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy due to a presumably allelic form of this disease. Symptoms began at age 29 years with progressive difficulty walking up stairs. He showed hyperlordotic posture, waddling gait, and proximal limb weakness which was greater in the arms than the legs.
**Polyglucosan body disease, adult form, 263570 (3), AR**
Adult polyglucosan body neuropathy is a late-onset, slowly progressive disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. Patients typically present after age 40 years with a variable combination of cognitive impairment, pyramidal tetraparesis, peripheral neuropathy, and neurogenic bladder. Other manifestations include cerebellar dysfunction and extrapyramidal signs. The pathologic hallmark of the disorder is the widespread accumulation of round, intracellular polyglucosan bodies throughout the nervous system, which are confined to neuronal and astrocytic processes (summary by Lossos et al., 1998).
Robitaille et al. (1980) reported 4 patients with a clinically and histopathologically unusual disorder. Two of them were sibs; in Case 4, the authors stated that 'she is the sister of Case 3.' Curiously, the sex in Case 3 was not given explicitly or implicitly. The clinical manifestations were those of progressive lower and upper motor neuron deficits, marked sensory loss in the legs, neurogenic bladder, and, in 2 of the 4, dementia. Autopsy in 2 showed a profusion of microscopic bodies resembling corpora amylacea or Lafora bodies, but restricted to processes of neurons and astrocytes, rather than being perikaryotic. Similar but especially large bodies were seen within axons of sural nerves taken at biopsy from the other 2 patients. In addition to Lafora disease, polyglucosan bodies occur in type IV glycogenosis, in the 'normal' course of aging, in rats rendered diabetic by alloxan, and in a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (205250). Cases similar to those of Robitaille et al. (1980) were reported by Peress et al. (1979) and Suzuki et al. (1971).
Lossos et al. (1991) described 2 unrelated patients diagnosed by sural nerve biopsy. Both were offspring of consanguineous marriages. They presented clinically with late-onset pyramidal tetraparesis, micturition difficulties, peripheral neuropathy, and mild cognitive impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive white matter abnormalities in both. Lossos et al. (1991) found that branching enzyme activity in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes of the patients was about 15% of control values, whereas their children displayed values of 50 to 60%, consistent with heterozygous state of an autosomal recessive disorder.
Bruno et al. (1993) analyzed branching enzyme activity in muscle, peripheral nerve, and leukocytes from 2 Ashkenazi-Jewish patients with adult polyglucosan body disease and from 1 African American patient and 3 Caucasian patients with the same clinical and pathologic features. One patient was a 66-year-old woman with progressive gait disturbance for 13 years and urinary frequency and mild urgency incontinence for 5 years. She had signs of peripheral neuropathy. A brother died with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, but autopsy revealed adult polyglucosan body disease with marked central and peripheral nerve system involvement. A 46-year-old French Canadian woman had progressive gait disturbance and urinary incontinence over an 8-year period. Branching enzyme activity was normal in muscle specimens from all patients. The activity was markedly decreased in both leukocytes and peripheral nerve specimens of the 2 Jewish patients, and normal in nerve tissue and leukocytes from all non-Jewish patients. Bruno et al. (1993) concluded that there is a deficiency of branching enzyme in a subgroup of patients with APBD, in their experience of only Ashkenazi Jewish patients, and that APBD has more than one biochemical basis. Since the enzyme levels were normal in muscle, even in the Jewish patients, the defect is tissue-specific.
Rifai et al. (1994) reported the case of a 56-year-old man who presented with lower-limb stiffness and weakness that had progressed for 15 years. They found that he had a dementia that affected cortical and subcortical functions and that the cognitive deficits correlated with MRI findings of cortical atrophy and white matter abnormalities.
Lossos et al. (1998) reported 7 patients with APBD from 5 unrelated Jewish families: 4 were of Ashkenazi origin and 1 descended from both Ashkenazi and Sephardi ancestors. All patients manifested signs of CNS and PNS involvement, including gait abnormalities, micturition problems, paresthesias, and cognitive impairment. Brain MRI showed white matter abnormalities, and sural nerve biopsies showed intraaxonal polyglucosan bodies. None of the patients had cardiomyopathy or liver dysfunction. Leukocyte GBE activity was undetectable in all 7 patients and was reduced to about 50% in their tested children.
Mochel et al. (2012) reviewed the clinical features of 50 patients from 47 families with APBD confirmed by genetic analysis or GBE1 enzyme deficiency (less than 25% of controls). Most of the patients (73%) were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, although patients of Latin American, Pacific Islander, Caucasian, and Cambodian background were also identified. Almost all patients developed symptoms after age 40, most commonly bladder dysfunction. Impotence was also a common complaint among men. Gait difficulties due to spastic paraplegia were the second most common problem, and about 50% of patients lost ambulation in the mid-sixties. Most patients (94%) had loss of vibration sense in the lower limbs associated with an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with reduced compound motor action potentials. Sural nerve biopsy showed abundant intraaxonal polyglucosan bodies. Other variable common features included spasticity in the upper limbs (12%), saccadic pursuit (39%), slow saccades (20%), orthostatic hypotension (31%), and bradykinesia (14%). Brain and spinal imaging showed medullary and spinal atrophy, often with enlarged ventricles, cerebellar atrophy, thin corpus callosum, and periventricular and brainstem white matter lesions. Almost half of patients had mild attention and memory deficits. Overall, the patients had a median survival of 70 years, which is 8 years less than the general population.



FAM20C
**Raine syndrome, 259775 (3), AR**
Raine syndrome is a neonatal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia of early and aggressive onset that usually results in death within the first few weeks of life, although there have been some reports of survival into childhood. Radiographic studies show a generalized increase in the density of all bones and a marked increase in the ossification of the skull. The increased ossification of the basal structures of the skull and facial bones underlies the characteristic facial features, which include narrow prominent forehead, proptosis, depressed nasal bridge, and midface hypoplasia. Periosteal bone formation is also characteristic of this disorder and differentiates it from osteopetrosis and other known lethal and nonlethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasias. The periosteal bone formation typically extends along the diaphysis of long bones adjacent to areas of cellular soft tissue (summary by Simpson et al., 2009).
Kan and Kozlowski (1992) described the postmortem findings in an infant with generalized osteosclerosis and craniofacial dysplasia representing a lethal syndrome identical to that previously reported in single cases by Raine et al. (1989) and Kingston et al. (1991). The female fetus described by Raine et al. (1989) had the combination of microcephaly, exophthalmos, hypoplastic nose and midface, gum hyperplasia, cleft palate, apparently low-set ears, and osteosclerosis. The facies in the 2 earlier cases and that reported by Kan and Kozlowski (1992) was 'fishlike.' The choanal passages were atretic in the patient of Kingston et al. (1991) and severely stenotic in the patient of Kan and Kozlowski (1992). The patients of Raine et al. (1989) and of Kan and Kozlowski (1992) had hypoplastic lungs. Multiple fracture-like rib lesions were seen on x-ray in the cases of Kingston et al. (1991) and Kan and Kozlowski (1992) but were not confirmed on histologic examination. The case of Kingston et al. (1991) had consanguineous parents.
FitzPatrick et al. (1998) described a lethal multiple malformation syndrome they called desmosterolosis (602398) because of a generalized accumulation of desmosterol. Their patient had many features of Raine syndrome, including macrocephaly, hypoplastic nasal bridge, thick alveolar ridges, and gingival nodules. However, FitzPatrick et al. (1998) also studied postmortem tissues from the case of Raine syndrome reported by Kan and Kozlowski (1992) and found no accumulation of desmosterol.
Al Mane et al. (1996) demonstrated that intracranial calcification is a component of Raine syndrome. The patient reported by Al Mane et al. (1996) was the second of 3 affected sibs reported by Rejjal (1998). The parents were first cousins and had 2 other children who were normal. The first affected child, a female, lived only a few days and was described as having microcephaly, bulging eyes, choanal atresia, and generalized osteosclerosis. Ultrasound and CT studies of the brain showed prominent calcifications, and a brief report of the case was published by Patel et al. (1992) as an example of osteopetrosis. The second affected child, a boy, was reported by Al Mane et al. (1996). Respiratory distress due to choanal atresia was not relieved by conventional surgical treatment, and tracheostomy was performed. The child died at 8 weeks of age. Radiographic studies showed diffuse osteosclerosis and widespread periosteal thickening of mandible, clavicles, scapulae, ribs, and long bones. Widespread focal cerebral calcifications were demonstrated in the periventricular white matter and basal ganglia with some meningeal calcifications as well, and these were thought to correspond to the histologic calcifications reported in the brain by Kan and Kozlowski (1992). The third affected child from the fifth pregnancy was recognized to have the same syndrome by prenatal ultrasound examination. At birth the findings were virtually identical to those in the other sibs. Autosomal recessive inheritance seems very likely as the cause of this distinctive syndrome.
Shalev et al. (1999) described a newborn girl with a lethal sclerosing bone dysplasia leading to prenatal skeletal alterations and microcephaly, proptosis, hypoplastic nose and midface, small jaw, cleft palate, hypertrophied gums, intracranial calcifications, and generalized osteosclerosis. The patient closely resembled 6 previously reported infants that had been categorized as having Raine syndrome. Autosomal recessive inheritance was postulated based on parental consanguinity in several of the previous cases and in their patient.
Acosta et al. (2000) reported a preterm male infant, the first child of a consanguineous union, whose physical examination revealed craniofacial disproportion with microcephaly, wide fontanels, exophthalmos, low nasal root and hypoplastic nose, long philtrum, small mouth, high arched and narrow palate, micrognathia, dysplastic, low-set, and rounded ears, short neck, and arthrogryposis. Postmortem findings included hypoplastic lungs. Radiologic examination showed mild and localized increase of bone density in the cranial vault and skull base and facial bones and undermodeling in the long bones. Acosta et al. (2000) considered the findings characteristic of Raine dysplasia but with mild bone involvement, with only a localized bone sclerosis and absence of prenatal fractures. The consanguinity of the parents reinforced the hypothesis of autosomal recessive inheritance in this disorder.
Hulskamp et al. (2003) reported a consanguineous Turkish couple with 3 affected children in 7 pregnancies, including a fetus of 24 weeks' gestation with full clinical and autopsy findings consistent with Raine syndrome. In addition to the generalized osteosclerosis and appositional new bone formation seen in Raine syndrome, these patients had previously unreported meso- and severe telebrachyphalangy and urogenital anomalies.
Al-Gazali et al. (2003) reported an infant from an Arab family who presented at birth with severe craniofacial anomalies including a wide anterior fontanel, exophthalmos, severe depression of the nasal bridge with a hypoplastic midface, bilateral choanal atresia, and a large protruding tongue. All the limbs were short and the thorax was small. Radiologically, there was increased bone density in some bones, periosteal new bone formation, and marked bowing of the femurs, tibias, and ulnas. Al-Gazali et al. (2003) suggested that osteosclerosis in Raine syndrome is not necessarily severe and generalized, and that bowing of the long bones is another variable radiologic feature of the syndrome.
Chitayat et al. (2007) described prenatal ultrasound, autopsy, and neuropathologic findings in a stillborn infant with Raine syndrome, the offspring of nonconsanguineous parents. A 19-week ultrasound showed no striking abnormalities, and only a retrospective review showed hypertelorism and flat profile. Thus, most of the abnormalities, including intracerebral calcifications, seem to present late in pregnancy.
Survival Beyond Infancy
Simpson et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated boys with Raine syndrome who survived infancy and were aged 8 and 11 years. At birth, both had features typical of Raine syndrome, with craniofacial dysmorphism including brachycephaly, downslanted eyes, hypoplastic nose, and small downturned mouth. Proptosis was present at birth in one of the boys, but in the other it only became apparent at 9 months of age; the latter child also had a scaphocephalic, saddle-shaped head with a widely split metopic suture and very large anterior fontanel. Skeletal surveys revealed sclerotic bone disease in both patients. Both had hydrocephalus requiring placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, following which their early development, which had been impaired, was significantly improved. The 8-year-old boy underwent examination at 6 years of age, at which time tracheostomy due to poor central respiratory control and obstructive sleep apnea was considered. Craniofacial examination revealed turribrachycephaly, plagiocephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures, proptosis, depressed nasal bridge, small nose, protruding tongue, thick alveolar margins, high palate, abnormal teeth, and low-set ears. Radiography at 7 years of age revealed prominent metaphyseal sclerosis of the long bones and diffuse abnormalities of the skull, with thickening and coarse trabeculation and prominent mastoid bulges. At 11 years of age, the other boy had turribrachycephaly, hypertelorism, arched eyebrows, an inferiorly placed right eye, and low-set and protuberant ears with hearing aids in place for mixed hearing loss. Other features included a flat nasal bridge with rounded and bulbous nasal tip and prominent alae nasi, sunken midface, wide mouth with large tongue, and relative prognathism, and he was secondarily edentulous. He also had pectus excavatum, bulbous fingertips, thick fingers, and large halluces. He had visual impairment and dysphagia, and also displayed self-stimulating behavior. Both boys had short stature, with heights at or below the 5th centile; the 8-year-old's head circumference was in the 10th to 25th centile, whereas that of the 11-year-old was less than the 5th centile (50th centile for a 10-month-old infant). Both had severe developmental delay.
Fradin et al. (2011) reported 2 sisters, born of first-cousin parents of Algerian origin, who had an attenuated phenotype of Raine syndrome with normal psychomotor development at ages 4 years and 1 year, respectively. The older sister attended regular school and had normal speech and pictural drawing skills. Her height, weight, and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) were within normal ranges, and she had no sensorial anomalies or history of respiratory distress. She displayed attenuation of the dysmorphic features, with a high palate and small teeth with enamel dysplasia. The younger sister had short stature but weight and OFC were in the medium range, and she displayed moderate craniofacial dysmorphism. Both sisters had stenosis of the pyriform aperture without choanal atresia that was surgically repaired, and both had intracranial as well as renal calcifications. X-rays showed static or decreasing osteosclerosis compared to earlier radiographs.



ANKRD11
**KBG syndrome, 148050 (3), AD**
KBG syndrome is characterized by macrodontia of the upper central incisors, distinctive craniofacial findings, short stature, skeletal anomalies, and neurologic involvement that includes global developmental delay, seizures, and intellectual disability (summary by Sirmaci et al., 2011). Sirmaci et al. (2011) noted that it is likely that KBG syndrome is underdiagnosed, since many of the features, including intellectual disability, are mild, and none of the features is a prerequisite for diagnosis.
Herrmann et al. (1975) described 2 families in which multiple members had short stature, characteristic facies (telecanthus, wide eyebrows, brachycephaly), macrodontia, mental retardation, and skeletal anomalies (abnormal vertebrae, short metacarpals, short femoral necks). Male-to-male transmission occurred in 1 family. (The designation KBG syndrome follows Opitz's practice of using the initials of affected families' surnames.) Fryns and Haspeslagh (1984) described what appeared to be the same disorder in 2 sisters and their mother.
Parloir et al. (1977) reported an extensive family segregating KBG syndrome. Soekarman et al. (1994) provided follow-up information on 3 affected brothers reported by Parloir et al. (1977). They had an affected sister, and 3 other brothers, as well as their mother, were said to have partial expression. The adult height of the affected brothers was far below the 3rd centile, with arm spans exceeding stature by at least 9 cm. Relative shortness of the trunk was apparently secondary to mild vertebral skeletal anomalies observed at a young age, with anterior wedging of vertebrae and irregular upper and lower plates. Karyotype was normal male.
Zollino et al. (1994) diagnosed KBG syndrome in 6 sporadic cases. Two of their patients had hypoplasia of cerebellar vermis, 1 had cystic dysplasia of the kidney, and 1 had megalocornea; see 249310.
Devriendt et al. (1998) described the KBG syndrome in a mother and her daughter. At the age of 8 years and 2 months the daughter showed, on x-ray of the skull, very broad unerupted permanent central frontal incisors. The mother had very broad frontal incisors. The daughter had ventricular septal defect, treated surgically. During childhood, she suffered from chronic constipation and recurrent respiratory tract infections. She was retarded with an intelligence quotient of 58 at the age of 8 years. The mother was mildly mentally retarded and had required special education.
Smithson et al. (2000) reported 2 additional cases of KBG syndrome. They suggested that the diagnostic criteria should include hypertelorism, macrodontia, short stature (less than the 10th percentile), delayed bone maturation, skeletal anomalies, and developmental delay (IQ less than 80).
Tekin et al. (2004) reported a family from central Anatolia in which a father and 2 sons had KBG syndrome. All 3 patients had developmental delay and mild to moderate mental retardation. Physical features included short stature (less than 3rd percentile), a triangular face, low anterior and posterior hairlines, bushy eyebrows, large prominent ears, a long philtrum, anteverted nostrils with hypoplastic alae nasi, and wide upper central incisors. The hands were short with clinodactyly, and 1 of the sons had bilateral accessory cervical ribs, thoracic kyphosis, and irregular vertebral arches. The father also had thoracic kyphosis. All 3 men had undescended testes.
Brancati et al. (2004) reviewed 29 cases of the KBG syndrome in the literature and described 8 new patients. Six of the new patients were sporadic in occurrence, but in 2 families the disorder was transmitted from mildly affected mothers to their affected children. EEG anomalies with or without seizures, mixed hearing loss, palatal anomalies with secondary speech disorder, distinct age-related behavior (hyperactivity, anxiety, and poor concentration), and cryptorchidism are possible additional characteristics of the KBG syndrome. Less common manifestations were posterior fossa malformations, eye defects, and congenital heart defects.
Maegawa et al. (2004) diagnosed KBG syndrome in 3 unrelated boys and the mother of 1 of them. In addition to the characteristic macrodontia and dental anomalies, the patients had atypical facies and skeletal anomalies, including hand anomalies in 3 patients. Mental retardation and developmental delay were also present in 3 patients. In the mother-son case, the mother had a milder phenotype.
Skjei et al. (2007) described male twins with KBG syndrome and reviewed 46 published cases. They recommended that 4 or more of the 8 major criteria be present to make the diagnosis of KBG syndrome: macrodontia of the upper central incisors, characteristic facial appearance, hand anomalies, neurologic involvement, bone age 2 standard deviations below the mean, costovertebral anomalies, postnatal short stature, and presence of a first-degree relative with KBG syndrome. Skjei et al. (2007) stated that macrodontia had been observed in over 95% of reported cases but noted that the high frequency might be due to ascertainment bias.



NSD1
**Leukemia, acute myeloid, 601626 (1), AD, Somatic mutation**
Shields et al. (2003) published a case report on acute myeloid leukemia that presented as bilateral orbital myeloid sarcoma (or chloroma) in a previously healthy 25-month-old boy. Bone marrow biopsy revealed blasts and cells with maturing monocytic features. A final diagnosis of M5b AML was made. The authors reviewed the literature and concluded that leukemia may be the most likely diagnosis in a child with bilateral soft tissue orbital tumors.
**Sotos syndrome 1, 117550 (3), AD**
Sotos syndrome is a neurologic disorder characterized by overgrowth from the prenatal stage through childhood, with advanced bone age, an unusual face with large skull, acromegalic features and pointed chin, occasional brain anomalies and seizures, and impaired intellectual development (summary by Kurotaki et al., 2002).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Sotos Syndrome
Sotos syndrome-2 (SOTOS2; 614753) is caused by mutation in the NFIX gene (164005) on chromosome 19p13, and SOTOS3 (617169) is caused by mutation in the APC2 gene (612034) on chromosome 19p13.
Weaver syndrome (277590), which shows considerable phenotypic overlap with Sotos syndrome, has been shown to be caused by mutation in the EZH2 gene (601573) on chromosome 7q36.
Sotos et al. (1964) described 5 children with a disorder characterized by excessively rapid growth, acromegalic features, and a nonprogressive cerebral disorder with mental retardation. High-arched palate and prominent jaw were noted in several of them. Birth length was between the 90th and 97th centiles in all. Bone age was advanced in most.
Hook and Reynolds (1967) reported that affected children have large hands and feet from birth. Growth is rapid in the first years of life but final height may not be excessive. Bone age is advanced. The skull is large with moderate prognathism. Mild dilation of the cerebral ventricles, nonspecific EEG changes, and seizures have been observed. Poor coordination and mental retardation are features. In 2 patients, Bejar et al. (1970) found abnormal dermatoglyphics, normal growth hormone levels, and high levels of valine, isoleucine and leucine in the blood. The glycine-to-valine ratio seemed particularly useful in distinguishing patients from controls.
Ruvalcaba et al. (1980) found hamartomatous polyps of the intestine and melanin spots of the penis in 2 males with the Sotos syndrome. Halal (1983) reported that the older of the boys she reported with cerebral gigantism had pigmented spots on the genitalia and that the father had been found to have a rectal polyp--findings like those in the 2 unrelated adult males reported by Ruvalcaba et al. (1980).
Kaneko et al. (1987) found congenital heart defects in 5 of 10 patients with typical Sotos syndrome. Noreau et al. (1998) found that 3 of 14 Sotos syndrome patients had congenital heart defects. In a literature review, they found another 17 patients with variable cardiac defects, mostly closure defects, making an overall incidence of approximately 8%.
Goldstein et al. (1988) described 2 unrelated children with macrocephaly, excessive growth, strabismus, hypotonia and developmental delay, and improvement with age.
In a review, Cole and Hughes (1990) emphasized that the handicaps in Sotos syndrome are fewer than previously believed and tend to improve with age. The latter feature makes identification of affected adults difficult. Cole and Hughes (1994) clinically assessed 79 patients with a provisional diagnosis of Sotos syndrome and evaluated their photographs between ages 1 and 6 years. These photographs, together with photographs of first-degree relatives, also at ages 1 to 6 years, were reviewed by 4 clinical geneticists. In 41 probands, but no first-degree relatives, the facial gestalt was thought to be characteristic of Sotos syndrome. Comparison of anthropometric measurements, bone age, and developmental delay in these 41 probands showed marked differences between them and the remaining 38 probands. Length was identified as the most significantly increased prenatal parameter. In childhood, occipitofrontal head circumference (OFC), height, and weight were all increased. OFC remained above the 97th percentile in all but one case throughout childhood and adulthood, whereas height and weight had a tendency to return toward the mean. This 'normalization' was more pronounced in females and was probably related to their early puberty. Early developmental delay and an advanced bone age were seen in 100% and 84% of cases, respectively. Cole and Hughes (1994) suggested that facial gestalt, growth pattern, bone age, and developmental delay are the major diagnostic criteria. Using these criteria, no affected first-degree relatives were identified.
Scarpa et al. (1994) described a sister and brother with macrocrania and coarse face (frontal bossing, highly arched palate, prognathism, pointed chin, large ears). Psychomotor development of the sister, who also had advanced osseous maturation, improved significantly at the age of 7 years. Accelerated growth with normal bone age, optic atrophy, renal agenesis with contralateral double kidney, and significant mental retardation (IQ, 45) were shown in the brother at 3.5 years of age. The father of these children was tall, with macrocrania and large hands and feet. He had had learning difficulties in school and was a manual laborer. Scarpa et al. (1994) suggested that these children and their father showed different manifestations of Sotos syndrome. Allanson and Cole (1996) presented anthropometric evaluation of the head in 45 patients with Sotos syndrome between age 1 and 25 years. With increasing age, the face lengthens and the chin becomes more striking.
Opitz et al. (1998) reported an affected mother and daughter. The mother was described as a large infant and 'as tall as her teacher in school.' Her adult height was 185.4 cm, and she had mandibular prognathism and a prominent pointed chin. The daughter showed a prominent forehead with sparseness of frontal hair and a 'ruddy' or flushed complexion, especially of the nose and perioral area. She had prominent features of the congenital hypotonia/lymphedema sequence with hypermobile joints, especially at the knees and ankles, lymphedema nails (especially toenails), and a high total ridge count (TRC) of the fingertip dermatoglyphics. The mother also had a high TRC and a receding frontal hairline.
Robertson and Bankier (1999) reported 3 children with anthropometric and dysmorphologic features of classic Sotos syndrome in association with redundant skin folds, joint hypermobility, and, in 2 of the 3, vesicoureteric reflux. Robertson and Bankier (1999) thought the associated features suggested a coexisting connective tissue disorder. All the patients had a normal bone age. Although Sotos syndrome in its classically described form was not present, Robertson and Bankier (1999) concluded that this entity might reflect a related, perhaps allelic, condition.
Tatton-Brown et al. (2005) reviewed the clinical phenotype of 239 individuals with NSD1 abnormalities and found that facial dysmorphism, learning disability, and childhood overgrowth were present in 90% of individuals; however, both height and head circumference were within the normal range in 10% of individuals, indicating that overgrowth is not obligatory for the diagnosis of Sotos syndrome. A broad spectrum of associated clinical features was also present, the occurrence of which was largely independent of genotype: individuals with identical mutations had different phenotypes, all features present in patients with microdeletions were also observed in patients with mutations, and there was no correlation between deletion size and clinical phenotype.
Kotilainen et al. (2009) studied the dental manifestations of Sotos syndrome and found that one or more premolar teeth were absent in 9 (69%) of 13 affected children and adolescents. All of the patients with hypodontia had a heterozygous mutation in the NSD1 gene. The patient with the most severe phenotype of tooth agenesis, involving not only the second premolars and third molars but also 1 mandibular incisor, had a microdeletion encompassing the entire NSD1 gene, whereas the 4 patients with the mildest tooth phenotype included both patients with only missense mutations, suggesting that the severity of tooth agenesis might be related to the type of mutation. More than half of the patients had enamel defects or excessive tooth wear. Dental age, based on tooth formation, was within the normal range.
Fryssira et al. (2010) reported 2 boys with typical features of Sotos syndrome and mutations in the NSD1 gene; 1 patient also had cryptorchidism and vertebral anomalies. The authors noted that despite the wide range of phenotypic features, molecular analysis can correctly identify Sotos syndrome.
Tumor Formation
Maldonado et al. (1984) reported the association of malignant tumors in Sotos syndrome. Nance et al. (1990) described a 15-month-old child with Sotos syndrome and a paraspinal neuroblastoma. From this and other evidence, they concluded that children with this disorder may be at an increased risk for developing tumors. Gorlin et al. (1990) estimated a risk of 3.9% of benign or malignant tumors in Sotos syndrome. The same excess of neoplasms is present in other overgrowth syndromes. Le Marec et al. (1999) reported that one of a monozygotic twin pair, both of whom had Sotos syndrome, developed a diffuse gastric carcinoma containing signet ring cells at the age of 26. The young age of occurrence of this gastric carcinoma suggested a genetic factor. Leonard et al. (2000) reported 2 children with Sotos syndrome who had benign sacrococcygeal teratomas. Given that Sotos syndrome and sacrococcygeal teratoma are rare events, the authors suggested that these tumors may be due to the effects of overgrowth on tumor development.



KANSL1
**Koolen-De Vries syndrome, 610443 (3), AD**
Koolen-De Vries syndrome is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, friendly demeanor, and highly distinctive facial features, including tall, broad forehead, long face, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, tubular nose with bulbous nasal tip, and large ears. More variable features include cardiac or genitourinary anomalies and seizures (summary by Koolen et al., 2012).
Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) in a study of 1,200 mentally retarded individuals, Koolen et al. (2006) identified 3 individuals with interstitial, overlapping 17q21.31 microdeletions and a clearly recognizable clinical phenotype of mental retardation, hypotonia, and characteristic face. All 3 individuals showed severe hypotonia from birth onwards, leading to severely delayed motor development. None of the individuals could stand and/or walk before the age of 3 years. Facial features included long hypotonic face with ptosis, blepharophimosis, large and low-set ears, tubular pear-shaped nose with bulbous nasal tip, long columella with hypoplastic alae nasi, and a broad chin. In addition, they all had long fingers, nasal speech, and an amiable and friendly disposition. The deletions encompassed the MAPT (157140) and CRHR1 (122561) genes and were associated with a common inversion polymorphism. All 3 deletions were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and shown to have arisen de novo.
Koolen et al. (2008) described the clinical and molecular features of 22 patients with 17q21.31 deletion syndrome, including 11 previously reported patients and 11 newly ascertained patients. Common features included developmental delay with mild to moderate mental retardation, characteristic facies with long face, high forehead, large, prominent ears, upward-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, bulbous nasal tip, pear-shaped nose, and long, slender features. Other features included cardiac septal defects, seizures, and cryptorchidism. Most patients had a friendly demeanor.
Tan et al. (2009) reported 11 patients with the 17q21.31 deletion syndrome. The facial appearance was characterized by a long face with tall or broad forehead, upslanting palpebral fissures, anteverted ears with thickened or overfolded helices, tubular or pear-shaped nose with bulbous tip, and frequently open mouth. The facial features became more distinctive in early childhood compared to infancy. All patients had hypotonia, global delay, and expressive language delay, and most had a friendly disposition. Congenital cardiac defects included pulmonary stenosis in 3 (27.3%), septal defects in 2 (18.2%), and bicuspid aortic valve in 2 (18.2%), and 1 patient had a dilated aortic root. Other features included urologic anomalies, such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, vesicoureteric reflux, duplex kidney, renal scarring, and hydronephrosis, and CNS anomalies, such as seizures, corpus callosum defects, and ventriculomegaly. Joint hypermobility and/or hip dislocation/dysplasia were commonly seen, as were ectodermal anomalies of the hair, skin, and teeth. Previously unreported features included persistent fetal fingertip pads, recurrent elbow dislocation, conductive hearing loss, dental abnormalities, and hypertension due to renal scarring.
In a study of copy number variants (CNVs) in 15,767 children with intellectual disability and various congenital defects (cases) compared to CNVs in 8,329 unaffected adult controls, Cooper et al. (2011) identified the 17q21.31 deletion in 23 individuals and atypical deletions in 3 individuals. Detailed clinical information on 2 individuals with the atypical deletion showed typical phenotypic features of the syndrome.
Zollino et al. (2012) reported 2 unrelated girls with Koolen-De Vries syndrome due to de novo heterozygous truncating mutations in the KANSL1 gene (612452.0001 and 612452.0002). Both had failure to thrive in infancy, hypotonia, and delayed psychomotor development. Characteristic facial features included broad forehead, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, 'pear'-shaped nose with bulbous nasal tip, long philtrum, large ears, broad chin, abnormal hair texture, and sparse eyebrows. Both also had joint hyperextensibility. Neither had seizures, heart defects, or urinary anomalies. Both had a happy disposition.
Koolen et al. (2012) reported 2 unrelated patients with Koolen-De Vries syndrome due to de novo heterozygous truncating mutations in the KANSL1 gene (612452.0003 and 612452.0004). Both patients had delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, hypotonia, friendly personality, and characteristic facial features, including broad forehead, long face, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, and tubular nose with bulbous nasal tip. Both also had joint laxity, slender lower limbs, pes planus, sacral dimple, and abnormal hair color or texture. One patient had additional features, including cleft lip/palate, ventricular septal defect, cryptorchidism, hypermetropia, strabismus, and scoliosis.
Koolen et al. (2016) compared the clinical features of 45 patients with KDVS, including 33 with a 17q21.31 deletion and 12 with a KANSL1 mutation. Three of the patients had previously been reported. There were no differences of clinical importance between the 2 groups, indicating that haploinsufficiency for KANKL1 is sufficient to cause the core phenotype. However, 44% of those in the deletion group had large ears, compared to none in the mutation group. The patients had strikingly similar dysmorphic features, including long face, upslanting and narrow palpebral fissures, ptosis, epicanthal folds, tubular- or pear-shaped nose with bulbous nasal tip, and everted lower lip. Many had poor overall growth or short stature. Most had hypotonia, particularly in the neonatal period, and all showed delayed development with intellectual disability, ranging from borderline/mild to severe, and speech delay. Expressive language was more severely affected than receptive language, and 4 patients (11%) were nonverbal. About half of patients had seizures that were usually well-controlled, and although the majority (89%) had an amiable affect, about half had neuropsychologic disorders, including hyperactivity, anxiety, autistic features, impulsivity, and depression. Structural brain abnormalities occurred in 53% of patients and mainly consisted of corpus callosum hypoplasia/aplasia, enlarged ventricles, hydrocephalus, and/or heterotopias. Musculoskeletal anomalies were present in 77% of patients, and included tracheo/laryngomalacia, pectus excavatum or carinatum, scoliosis/kyphosis, hip dislocation/dysplasia, joint hypermobility, and positional deformities of the feet. Other common abnormalities included congenital heart defects (39%), urogenital anomalies (45%), and ectodermal abnormalities (67%).
Myers et al. (2017) reviewed the seizure phenotypes of 31 patients with KDVS who had seizures, noting that seizures occur in about 50% of patients with the disorder. The mean age at seizure onset was 3.5 years (range, 4 months to 24 years). Most patients presented with focal impaired awareness and staring spells in infancy, often associated with autonomic signs, such as pallor, vomiting, and oxygen desaturation. Twenty-one patients had prolonged seizures, including status epilepticus. Nine (41%) of 22 patients had refractory seizures, but seizures could be variably controlled in the long term in other patients. EEG studies were available for 26 patients, most of which showed focal or multiform epileptiform discharges; 2 patients had spike-wave discharges with 3-4 Hz frequency. Variable structural brain abnormalities were found in all patients, and mainly included corpus callosum dysgenesis, abnormal hippocampi, and dilated ventricles. Less common MRI findings included periventricular nodular heterotopia, focal cortical dysplasia, abnormal sulcation, and abnormalities of the brainstem and cerebellum. All individuals had delayed development and intellectual disability, but the degree of cognitive impairment varied, with 6 patients mildly affected, 8 patients moderately affected, and 17 more severely affected.



IL1RAPL1
**Mental retardation, X-linked 21/34, 300143 (3), XLR**
This form of nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation is characterized by a spectrum of cognitive neurologic impairments or disabilities ranging from moderate mental retardation to high-functioning autism. Males are typically severely affected, but some carrier females may manifest milder deficits (summary by Piton et al., 2008).
Kozak et al. (1993) reported a 3-generation Italian family in which 4 male patients had moderate mental retardation without any specific or consistent phenotypic abnormalities. One obligate female carrier had mild retardation and another 2 had normal intelligence, suggesting incomplete penetrance in females.
Piton et al. (2008) reported a family in which 3 brothers had mental retardation with variable autistic features. The 8-year-old proband had mental retardation and showed some autistic signs, but was too impaired to be formally tested. The proband's 2 brothers had a less severe cognitive phenotype: one had pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDDNOS), and the other had mild mental retardation with repetitive behaviors, but no other signs of autism. Their carrier mother was unaffected.
Franek et al. (2011) reported 2 unrelated families with X-linked mental retardation resulting from deletions encompassing the immunoglobulin domain of the IL1RAPL1 gene. Three affected males in the first family had low IQ and other variable features, including hypotonia (2), pectus excavatum (2), prominent jaw (2), synophrys (2), and hyperextensible joints (2). Two had behavioral abnormalities, including impulsivity, oppositional disorder, and hyperactivity. One had pigmentary skin changes. Genetic analysis identified a 635-kb deletion spanning exons 2-5 in the IL1RAPL1 gene (see 300206.0003), although exact deletion breakpoints were not mapped. In the second family, there were 5 affected males, but only 2 brothers were described in detail. Both had moderate intellectual disability and seizures. Both had prominent jaw, strabismus, and hyperextensible elbows; 1 had synophrys and the other had depression. One of the brothers carried a fragile site at Xq28 (FRAXF; 300031) (Parrish et al., 1994), and both had a deletion of exons 1-5 of the IL1RAPL1 gene, which was inherited from their unaffected mother. None of the patients reported by Franek et al. (2011) had autism.
Clinical Variability
Piton et al. (2008) reported a French Canadian girl with high functioning autism consistent with Asperger syndrome and no mental retardation who had a heterozygous de novo 7-bp deletion (1730delTACTCTT) in exon 9 of the IL1RAPL1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The truncated protein was predicted to lack part of the transmembrane domain as well as the entire cytoplasmic domain and was not found in 276 control chromosomes. Although in vitro studies in rat hippocampal cells indicated that the deletion resulted in a loss of function, transfection of the truncated mutant alone did not affect neurite outgrowth.



TNXB
**Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, 1, 606408 (3), AR**
Classic-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by hyperextensible skin, hypermobile joints, and tissue fragility (Burch et al., 1996).
For a phenotypic description of classic-type EDS, see 130000.
Burch et al. (1996) reported a 25-year-old man with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910), associated with a classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (see 130000)-like phenotype, consisting of hyperextensible skin and joints, patellar chondromalacia, and easy bruising. In their full report, Burch et al. (1997) described atypical histologic findings that suggested a novel mechanism of disease in their proband: the most striking findings were abnormal elastin (130160) bodies beneath the dermal-epidermal junction, a diffuse increase in perivascular matrix, and uneven packing of the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerves.
To investigate the role of tenascins in EDS, Schalkwijk et al. (2001) screened serum samples from 151 patients with the classic, hypermobility, or vascular types of EDS for the presence of tenascin-X and tenascin-C (187380) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The same assays were done in 75 patients with psoriasis, 93 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 21 healthy persons. Absence of tenascin-X from the serum was found in 5 unrelated patients, all of whom had recessive EDS and 1 of whom also had CAH. All 5 tenascin-X-deficient patients and 3 clinically affected tenascin-X-deficient sibs had hyperelastic skin and hypermobile joints, fulfilling major diagnostic criteria for classic EDS. Minor diagnostic criteria supporting the diagnosis of classic EDS in these patients and their affected sibs included easy bruising in all, velvety skin in 7, joint pain in 2, and multiple subluxations in 3. Although the findings were similar to those of classic EDS, all tenascin-X-deficient patients lacked atrophic scars, a major diagnostic criteria for classic EDS. Delayed wound healing, which is also common in classic EDS, was not present in any of these patients, although it was noted in the tenascin-X-deficient patient reported by Burch et al. (1997). However, it was possible that treatment with glucocorticoids for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in that patient may have played a role in delayed wound healing. The tenascin-X-deficient patients reported by Schalkwijk et al. (2001) also had a range of additional clinical findings not typically associated with EDS, including congenital adrenal hyperplasia, spina bifida occulta, mitral valve prolapse, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and premature arteriosclerosis. It was not clear whether these additional disorders were related to tenascin-X deficiency. None of the parents of the 5 patients with tenascin-X deficiency were related, and none of the 4 parents available for study had clinical signs of EDS. The authors identified mutations in the TNX gene in all 5 patients.
Lindor and Bristow (2005) described 2 unrelated patients with complete deficiency of tenascin-X who had marked skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, and joint laxity. Unlike classic EDS patients, they did not have atrophic scarring or poor wound healing. Significant medical problems occurring in these individuals included severe diverticular intestinal disease with ruptured diverticula, pancolonic diverticulitis, and rectal prolapse, mitral valve prolapse requiring valve replacement, and obstructive airway disease. One patient had 3 daughters, presumed heterozygotes, who had minimal clinical expression of a tenascin-X deficiency phenotype and did not meet the diagnostic criteria for EDS.
Chen et al. (2009) reported an 8-year-old 46,XX girl, born with ambiguous genitalia, bicornuate uterus, single kidney, and grade III vesicoureteral reflux, who was found to have 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Examination at 8 years of age revealed bifid uvula, single palmar crease on the left hand, normal skin, mild arachnodactyly, and hyperextensible joints with a Beighton score of 8/9. Her mother, who had a history of urethral prolapse and hiatus hernia, also had hyperextensible joints (Beighton score, 7/9), and her maternal grandfather had hyperextensible thumbs, whereas her father had a Beighton score of 0/9. Cardiac MRI revealed a quadricuspid aortic valve in the proband; her mother had mild mitral valve prolapse and trace regurgitation by transthoracic echocardiogram.
**Vesicoureteral reflux 8, 615963 (3), AD**
Gbadegesin et al. (2013) reported a large 5-generation family in which 9 individuals had radiologically confirmed vesicoureteral reflux and/or duplex collecting systems. Two affected mutation carriers who were examined showed signs of asymptomatic joint hypermobility.



RB1
**Bladder cancer, somatic, 109800 (3)**
Patients with cancer of the urinary bladder often present with multiple tumors appearing at different times and at different sites in the bladder. This observation had been attributed to a 'field defect' in the bladder that allowed the independent transformation of epithelial cells at a number of sites. Sidransky et al. (1992) tested this hypothesis with molecular genetic techniques and concluded that in fact multiple bladder tumors are of clonal origin. A number of bladder tumors can arise from the uncontrolled spread of a single transformed cell. These tumors can then grow independently with variable subsequent genetic alterations.
Dyrskjot et al. (2003) reported the identification of clinically relevant subclasses of bladder carcinoma using expression microarray analysis of 40 well-characterized bladder tumors. Gene expression profiles characterizing each stage and subtype identified their biologic properties, producing potential targets for therapy.
**Osteosarcoma, somatic, 259500 (3)**
Harmon and Morton (1966) reported osteogenic sarcoma in 4 sibs, with onset at 11, 15, 20, and 22 years. Epstein et al. (1970) observed osteogenic sarcoma in a father and daughter. See chondrosarcoma (215300).
Goorin et al. (1985) stated that 16 sets of sibs with osteosarcoma had been identified.
The demonstration of evidence of immune response (lysis of radiolabeled tumor cells by donor lymphocytes) in household contacts of patients with osteosarcoma (Levin et al., 1974) suggested that the familial aggregation may be due to a transmitted agent.
**Retinoblastoma, trilateral, 180200 (3), AD, Somatic mutation**
Retinoblastoma (RB) is an embryonic malignant neoplasm of retinal origin. It almost always presents in early childhood and is often bilateral. Spontaneous regression ('cure') occurs in some cases. The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) was the first tumor suppressor gene cloned. It is a negative regulator of the cell cycle through its ability to bind the transcription factor E2F (189971) and repress transcription of genes required for S phase (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).
Connolly et al. (1983) reported a 4-generation family with 3 patterns of expression of the retinoblastoma gene: frank retinoblastoma, unilateral or bilateral; retinoma; and no visible retinal pathology except for 'normal degeneration' with age. ('Paving stone degeneration' of the type observed in 2 of 3 RB carriers, aged 49 and 59, is said by Duane (1980) to occur in about 20% of the adult population.)
In a review, Balmer et al. (2006) noted that the most common presenting signs of retinoblastoma are leukocoria (a late sign) and strabismus (an early sign), but that many other ocular or general signs have been observed. Although the malignant tumor is curable with early treatment, there remains in the heritable form a major risk of second nonocular primary tumors.
Retinoma
Gallie and Phillips (1982) described benign lesions in the retina in retinoblastoma patients. The distinctive characteristics of these lesions, referred to by the authors as retinomas, included a translucent, grayish retinal mass protruding into the vitreous, 'cottage-cheese' calcification in 75%, and retinal pigment epithelial migration and proliferation in 60%. They suggested that retinomas represent not the heterozygous state postulated by the Knudson 2-stage model of carcinogenesis but rather the homozygous state occurring in differentiated cell(s). Gallie et al. (1982) suggested that retinomas represent either spontaneous regression of a retinoblastoma or a benign manifestation of the RB gene.
Trilateral Retinoblastoma
Brownstein et al. (1984) described 3 children with bilateral retinoblastoma and a morphologically similar neoplasm in the region of the pineal. They referred to this as trilateral retinoblastoma. The pineal gland has sometimes been referred to as 'the third eye.' Lueder et al. (1991) described a fourth case of pinealoma associated with bilateral retinoblastoma. The patient was one of 56 with heritable RB. Amoaku et al. (1996) reported 5 patients with trilateral retinoblastoma (including 2 previously reported), diagnosed among 146 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma in the West Midlands Health Authority Region in England between 1957 and 1994. This represented an incidence of 3%. There were 4 patients with pineoblastoma, only 1 of whom had a positive family history. The mean age at diagnosis of RB in the entire series was 6 months, whereas the patients with pineoblastoma were diagnosed at a mean age of 2 years. The tumors were not evident on the initial computed tomographic (CT) scans. One child presented with a calcified suprasellar mass 13 months before bilateral sporadic retinoblastoma was identified. Death occurred within 1 month of diagnosis of the intracranial tumor in 3 patients who received no treatment. In the other 2 patients, who were treated, death occurred at 15 months and 2 years, respectively, after diagnosis of intracranial tumor.
Kivela (1999) performed a metaanalysis of trilateral retinoblastoma by reviewing the literature systematically and contacting authors to obtain missing information. Data from 106 children were used to determine frequency and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. No sex predilection was found. Median age at diagnosis of retinoblastoma was 5 months (range, 0 to 29 months); age at diagnosis was younger among 47 children (47%) with familial retinoblastoma compared with age at diagnosis among 52 children (53%) with sporadic retinoblastoma (2 vs 6.5 months; P less than 0.0001). Trilateral retinoblastoma usually affected the second or third generation with retinoblastoma. Median time from retinoblastoma to trilateral retinoblastoma was 21 months (range, 6 months before to 141 months after); time to trilateral retinoblastoma was longer for 78 (77%) pineal tumors compared with 23 (23%) suprasellar tumors (32 vs 6.5 months; P less than 0.0001). The size and prognosis of pineal and suprasellar tumors were similar. Screening by neuroimaging improved outcome. The cure rate was improved when the tumors were at or below 15 mm at the time of detection.
Karatza et al. (2006) reported a pineal cyst simulating pineoblastoma in 11 children with retinoblastoma (2 familial and 9 sporadic).
Second Primary Tumors
The risk of osteogenic sarcoma is increased 500-fold in bilateral retinoblastoma patients, the bone malignancy being at sites removed from those exposed to radiation treatment of the eye tumor (Abramson et al., 1976). Francois (1977) concluded that there is a special predisposition to osteogenic sarcoma, both radiogenic and nonradiogenic, in retinoblastoma patients and possibly in their relatives. Matsunaga (1980) estimated that the relative risk of development of nonradiogenic osteosarcoma in persons with the retinoblastoma gene is 230. That osteosarcoma is a direct effect of the genomic change that underlies retinoblastoma is indicated by the cases of osteosarcoma without retinoblastoma but with genomic changes like those of retinoblastoma.
Chauveinc et al. (2001) reviewed retinoblastoma survivors who subsequently developed osteosarcoma. They found that osteosarcomas occurred 1.2 years earlier inside than outside the radiation field in patients who had undergone external beam irradiation. Also, the latency between radiotherapy and osteosarcoma was 1.3 years shorter inside than outside the radiation field. Bimodal distribution of latency periods was observed for osteosarcomas arising inside but not outside the radiation field: 40% occurred after a short latency, while the latency for the remaining 60% was comparable to that of osteosarcoma arising outside the radiation field. The authors suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in the radiocarcinogenesis. They hypothesized that a radiation-induced mutation of the second RB1 allele may be the cause of osteosarcomas occurring after a short delay, while other genes may be responsible for osteosarcomas occurring after a longer delay.
To understand why the RB protein is specifically targeted in osteosarcoma, Thomas et al. (2001) studied its function in osteogenesis. Loss of RB but not p107 (116957) or p130 (180203) blocked late osteoblast differentiation. RB physically interacted with the osteoblast transcription factor, CBFA1 (600211), and associated with osteoblast-specific promoters in vivo in a CBFA1-dependent fashion. Association of RB with CBFA1 and promoter sequences resulted in synergistic transactivation of an osteoblast-specific reporter. This transactivation function was lost in tumor-derived RB mutants, underscoring a potential role in tumor suppression. Thus, RB functions as a direct transcriptional coactivator promoting osteoblast differentiation, which may contribute to the targeting of RB in osteosarcoma.
Friend et al. (1987) found that the same DNA segment that they had isolated from 13q14 and showed to have attributes of the retinoblastoma gene is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma. Almost two-thirds of the secondary tumors arising in patients with retinoblastoma are mesenchymal in origin. Over 60% of the mesenchymal tumors are osteosarcomas; the soft tissue sarcomas include fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and others. Friend et al. (1987) specifically demonstrated homozygous deletions of the RB1 locus in sporadic cases of leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma in the absence of any history of retinoblastoma. Friend et al. (1988) reviewed the subject of tumor-suppressing genes in retinoblastoma and other disorders.
Henson et al. (1994) found loss of heterozygosity for the RB1 protein in 16 of 54 informative high-grade astrocytomas but not in 12 low-grade gliomas. Deletion mapping with ranking markers revealed that the retinoblastoma locus was preferentially targeted by the deletions. SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing demonstrated mutations in the remaining retinoblastoma allele. This evidence suggested to the authors that whereas mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene (191170) is an early event in the formation of many astrocytomas, mutation of the retinoblastoma gene is associated with progression of the astrocytoma into high-grade astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme. Previous work had demonstrated frequent loss of 9p, 10, 13q, 17p, 19q, and 22q in astrocytomas. Mutations in the RB1 gene were described.
Cance et al. (1990) found that leiomyosarcomas and other soft tissue sarcomas in which expression of the RB gene product was decreased were more aggressive than tumors in which this protein was expressed by nearly all cells.
Moll et al. (2001) evaluated the influence of age at external beam irradiation (EBRT) on the occurrence of second primary tumors (SPTs) inside and outside the irradiation field in 263 patients with hereditary retinoblastoma. They calculated cumulative incidences of SPT in 3 subgroups: irradiation before 12 months of age (early EBRT), irradiation after 12 months of age (late EBRT), and no irradiation. They found that hereditary RB conferred an increased risk of the development of SPT, especially in patients treated with EBRT before 12 months of age. However, they concluded that the presence of similar numbers of SPTs inside and outside the irradiation field suggested that irradiation was not the cause. The authors concluded that their study did not show an age effect on radiation-related risk, but rather that early EBRT is probably a marker for other risk factors of SPT.
Kivela et al. (2001) analyzed the association between retinoblastoma and sebaceous carcinoma (SC) of the eyelid to improve surveillance of RB survivors. They studied 11 children with hereditary RB who subsequently developed eyelid SC. Nine of the children developed SC within the field of radiation. All 9 had received a median of 46 Gy (range, 21-89) of EBRT at a median age of 16 months (range, 0.5-15 years of age). Their median age at SC diagnosis was 14 years (range, 8-30 years) and median interval from EBRT to SC diagnosis was 11 years (range, 5-26 years). The 2 children who had never received EBRT developed eyelid SC at ages 32 and 54 years. In this series, the cumulative probability of a 5-year survival of eyelid SC was 87%. The authors concluded that SC of the eyelid may occur in patients with hereditary RB regardless of primary treatment, especially within the EBRT field 5 to 15 years after radiotherapy.
Brantley et al. (2002) examined expression of p53 and Rb tumor suppressor pathways in uveal melanomas following plaque radiotherapy. They found that plaque radiotherapy damaged DNA, inhibited cell division, and promoted cell death. They stated that these changes might be due, at least in part, to induction of p53, which activates genes involved both in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Their results also showed that plaque radiotherapy can cause alterations in the expression of Rb, but the authors noted that the significance of the latter finding would require further study.
Gombos et al. (2007) identified 15 retinoblastoma patients with secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML; see 601626), 13 of whom developed sAML in childhood. Mean latent period from RB to AML diagnosis was 9.8 years (median, 42 months). Nine cases were of the M2 or M5 French-American-British subtypes. Twelve patients (79%) had received chemotherapy with a topoisomerase II inhibitor, and 8 (43%) had received chemotherapy with an epipodophyllotoxin. Ten children died of their leukemia. Gombos et al. (2007) questioned whether chemotherapy was a risk factor for the development of sAML in this series of patients.

CNTNAP2
**{Autism susceptibility 15}, 612100 (3)**
Autism, the prototypic pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), is usually apparent by 3 years of age. It is characterized by a triad of limited or absent verbal communication, a lack of reciprocal social interaction or responsiveness, and restricted, stereotypic, and ritualized patterns of interests and behavior (Bailey et al., 1996; Risch et al., 1999). 'Autism spectrum disorder,' sometimes referred to as ASD, is a broader phenotype encompassing the less severe disorders Asperger syndrome (see ASPG1; 608638) and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). 'Broad autism phenotype' includes individuals with some symptoms of autism, but who do not meet the full criteria for autism or other disorders. Mental retardation coexists in approximately two-thirds of individuals with ASD, except for Asperger syndrome, in which mental retardation is conspicuously absent (Jones et al., 2008). Genetic studies in autism often include family members with these less stringent diagnoses (Schellenberg et al., 2006).
For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of autism, see 209850.
**Pitt-Hopkins like syndrome 1, 610042 (3), AR**
PTHSL1 is an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment or regression, and behavioral abnormalities. Most patients have onset of seizures within the first years of life. Some patients may have cortical dysplasia on brain imaging (summary by Smogavec et al., 2016).
Strauss et al. (2006) described a clinical and neuropathologic phenotype, which they called cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy syndrome (CDFES), in 9 children in the Old Order Amish of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. During infancy, all patients had mild gross motor delay and subtle limitations in motor skills. Eight of 9 children had good language comprehension and general development by age 18 months. There were no distinguishing physical features, and growth trajectories were normal, although all patients had relatively large heads and diminished or absent deep-tendon reflexes. Severe intractable seizures began between 2 and 7 years of age and were associated with deterioration of learning ability and social behavior. Those older than 3 years had language regression, aberrant social interactions, and mental retardation, and showed hyperactivity, inattention, and aggression. Brain MRI showed focal malformations in 3 of 7 patients studied: 2 had unilateral dysplasia of the anterior temporal lobe and 1 had a malformation of the left striatum. Resective surgery did not prevent the recurrence of seizures. The long-term outcome was poor, with patients fully dependent on others for daily living.
Pitt-Hopkins-Like Syndrome 1
Orrico et al. (2001) described 2 sibs, a brother and sister, with severe mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies including coarse facial features, short stature, seizures, hypertrichosis, short great toes, and overbreathing. The authors stated that comparison of these patients with previous reports suggested that they could represent the first familial cases of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS; 610954). Peippo et al. (2006) noted that the clinical features of the sibs described by Orrico et al. (2001) differed in several respects from those of other PTHS patients described in the literature. The noses were merely large as opposed to beaked with flared nostrils; upper lips lacked the typical curving; both sibs had unilateral ptosis not found in other patients; and motor development was normal. Breathing abnormality also differed, with loss of consciousness in the elder sib during apnea, and breathing irregularity without apnea in the younger sib. In a follow-up of the 2 sibs reported by Orrico et al. (2001), Zweier et al. (2009) stated that the patients had normal growth apart from short stature, lack of speech development, and no specific facial dysmorphism aside from thick lips and wide mouth. Seizure onset was around 2 years of age, and 1 patient had cerebellar hypoplasia. Autistic features were not noted.
Zweier et al. (2009) also reported an 11-year-old girl with normal growth, severe mental retardation, lack of speech development, and onset of seizures at 4 to 8 months of age. She had hyperbreathing and showed stereotypic behaviors, such as teeth grinding, as well as autistic behavior. She was considered normal until age 8 months and thereafter showed developmental regression. Brain MRI results were not known. Zweier et al. (2009) noted that this patient had a similar phenotype to that reported by Orrico et al. (2001).
Smogavec et al. (2016) reported 8 patients from 6 unrelated families with moderate to severe intellectual disability with speech impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and early-onset seizures. The patients were ascertained from different genetics or pediatric neurology centers worldwide, and ranged from 2 to 47 years of age. Most had very poor or absent speech with few words and poor verbal comprehension, and several patients had loss of verbal skills or stagnation of language development. The patients had delayed walking between 18 and 5 years; 1 patient was nonambulatory at age 14. Seizure types included complex focal, focal tonic, temporal, and generalized, with EEG showing focal seizures as well as generalized slowing. Most patients had a favorable response to antiepileptic medication. Brain imaging showed suspected temporal cortical dysplasia in 2 patients and vermian atrophy in another, but MRI was normal in 3. Other variable neurologic abnormalities included hyporeflexia, hypotonia, ataxia, and spasticity. Behavioral anomalies included stereotypic hand movements, aggressivity, autoaggressivity, and reduced eye contact. One patient had hyperventilation. There were no significant or common facial dysmorphic features. Of note, 2 adult brothers had variable severity: 1 had severe intellectual disability and was nonverbal at age 47, whereas the other had moderate intellectual disability with basic literacy skills and could speak at age 40.



NALCN
**Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay, 616266 (3), AD**
CLIFAHDD is a congenital disorder characterized by congenital contractures of the limbs and face, resulting in characteristic facial features, hypotonia, and variable degrees of developmental delay. All reported cases have occurred de novo (summary by Chong et al., 2015).
Chong et al. (2015) reported 14 unrelated children with a similar congenital disorder characterized by severe contractures of the limbs, abnormal facial features, hypotonia, and variable degrees of developmental delay. Characteristic facial features included downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, anteverted nasal tip, large nares, short columella, long philtrum, micrognathia, pursed lips, H-shaped chin dimpling, deep nasolabial folds, and full cheeks. Limb deformities included camptodactyly, adducted thumbs, ulnar deviation, positional foot deformities ranging from varus deformity to severe clubfoot, and contractures of the elbows and knees. Patients also had short neck, scoliosis, and hip contractures. Many patients had neonatal respiratory distress and abnormal breathing patterns. All patients had global developmental delay with poor speech, and some had seizure-like activity. Brain MRI in some patients was normal, whereas others had cerebellar and/or cerebral atrophy. More variable features included gastroesophageal reflux and inguinal or umbilical hernia.
**Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1, 615419 (3), AR**
Infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies (IHPRF) is a severe autosomal recessive neurologic disorder with onset at birth or in early infancy. Affected individuals show very poor, if any, normal cognitive development. Some patients are never learn to sit or walk independently (summary by Al-Sayed et al., 2013).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Infantile Hypotonia with Psychomotor Retardation and Characteristic Facies
See also IHPRF2 (616801), caused by mutation in the UNC80 gene (612636) on chromosome 2q34; and IHPRF3 (616900), caused by mutation in the TBCK gene (616899) on chromosome 4q24.
Seven et al. (2002) described a Turkish brother and sister, offspring of a first-cousin marriage, who were affected with severe neurodegeneration beginning in infancy. Both developed normally until about 6 months of age, and thereafter showed severe psychomotor regression and poor postnatal growth with microcephaly. They had lack of head control, inability to sit or walk, and no eye-to-eye contact or sense of vision or speech. Additional neurologic features included truncal hypotonia, widespread muscle atrophy, spastic tetraparesis with hyperreflexia, nystagmus, and optic atrophy. Facial dysmorphism was notable, with prominent forehead, strabismus, small nose, wide mouth (in the boy), micrognathia, and large, low-set ears. Both also had pectus carinatum and pes varus. One patient had a normal brain MRI at age 3 years, whereas the other showed cerebellar atrophy at age 5. EMG showed decreased motor nerve conduction velocities. Electron microscopy of sural nerve biopsy from 1 patient showed unmyelinated axons, spheroid formation, and edema, consistent with a clinical diagnosis of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. Seven et al. (2002) suggested that facial dysmorphism could permit diagnosis in the first months of life without any clinical or neurologic signs.
Koroglu et al. (2013) provided follow-up of the family reported by Seven et al. (2002). The patients were 21 and 18 years of age. Anthropomorphic measures later in childhood and as young adults showed severe growth impairment and microcephaly (-4 SD). Additional features included seizures and contractures. One of the patients had miscellaneous features, such as scoliosis and cryptorchidism.
Al-Sayed et al. (2013) reported 6 patients from 2 consanguineous Saudi Arabian families with IHPRF. The 3 patients in 1 family presented at birth with severe neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, followed by severe psychomotor retardation with lack of speech development. None of the children could sit without support at 4 to 7 years of age. Other features included severe constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, and initial failure to thrive. One patient had white matter abnormalities on brain MRI; muscle biopsy of 1 patient was normal. The 3 patients in the second family had the same features, but were less severely affected. At ages 9 to 17 years, these patients were able to walk independently since 2 to 3 years of age, and they could speak a few words; IQ measured in the forties. All 3 members of this family had constipation, hyperactivity, and controlled seizures. Dysmorphic facial features present in all patients from both families included brachycephaly, broad forehead, triangular face, smooth philtrum, prominent slender nose, and thin upper lip. Patients in 1 family had large low-set ears. Sural nerve biopsies were not performed.



GHR
**Increased responsiveness to growth hormone, 604271 (3), AD**
**{Hypercholesterolemia, familial, modifier of}, 143890 (3), AD**
Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elevation of serum cholesterol bound to low density lipoprotein (LDL), which promotes deposition of cholesterol in the skin (xanthelasma), tendons (xanthomas), and coronary arteries (atherosclerosis). The disorder occurs in 2 clinical forms: homozygous and heterozygous (Hobbs et al., 1992).
The FHCL1 phenotype can be modified by mutation in other genes. For example, in individuals with the LDLR mutation IVS14+1G-A (606945.0063), the phenotype can be altered by a SNP in the APOA2 gene (107670.0002), a SNP in the EPHX2 gene (132811.0001), or a SNP in the GHR gene (600946.0028).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Familial Hypercholesterolemia
Other forms of monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia include FHCL2 (144010), caused by mutation in the APOB gene (107730); FHCL3 (603776), caused by mutation in the PCSK9 gene (607786); and FHCL4 (603813), caused by mutation in the LDLRAP1 gene (605747).
Individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia develop tendinous xanthomas, corneal arcus, and coronary artery disease; the last usually becomes evident in the fourth or fifth decade. Homozygous individuals have a more severe clinical picture with earlier presentation, usually in the first 2 decades of life (Hobbs et al., 1992).
The ranges of serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are, in mg per dl, 250-450 and 200-400 in heterozygotes, greater than 500 and greater than 450 in homozygous affecteds, and 150-250 and 75-175 in homozygous unaffecteds, with some positive correlation with age (Khachadurian, 1964; Kwiterovich et al., 1974).
In homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the aortic root is prone to develop atherosclerotic plaque at an early age. Such plaques can accumulate in unusual sites, such as the ascending aorta and around the coronary ostia. Summers et al. (1998) evaluated the aortic root using MRI imaging in a blinded, prospective study of 17 homozygous FH patients and 12 healthy controls. When patient age and body mass index were taken into account, 53% of patients with homozygous FH had increased aortic wall thickness compared to controls; this was thought to result from a combination of medial hyperplasia and plaque formation. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was seen in 41% of patients.
Houlston et al. (1988) studied the relationship of lipoprotein(a) (152200) levels and coronary heart disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Individuals with coronary artery disease had a significantly higher mean lipoprotein(a) concentration than those without coronary heart disease, suggesting that lipoprotein(a) measurements may help predict the risk of coronary heart disease in individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia.
Deramo et al. (2003) investigated the relationship between nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION; 258660) and serum lipid levels in 37 consecutive patients diagnosed with NAION at or below age 50 years and 74 age- and gender-matched controls. They found that hypercholesterolemia was a risk factor in these patients and suggested that NAION might be the first manifestation of a previously unrecognized lipid disorder. The patients had experienced a focal, microvascular central nervous system ischemic event at a relatively young age. Deramo et al. (2003) suggested that aggressive treatment of lipid abnormalities might be warranted in these patients.
**Laron dwarfism, 262500 (3), AR**
Laron syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by marked short stature that results from failure to generate insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1; 147440) in response to growth hormone (GH; 139250). GH levels are normal or increased. The disorder is caused by dysfunction of the growth hormone receptor.
A Laron syndrome-like phenotype associated with immunodeficiency (245590) is caused by a postreceptor defect, i.e., mutation in the STAT5B gene (604260).
Patients with mutations in the GHR gene that cause only partial insensitivity to growth hormone have a form of short stature (604271).
Dysfunction of GHR is characterized by clinical hyposomatotropism manifest by short stature, delayed bone age, and occasionally blue sclerae and hip degeneration. Additional features include delayed bone maturation and the absence of bone dysplasias and chronic diseases. Laron syndrome patients have low IGF1 despite normal or increased levels of GH. The GH is functionally normal by the criteria that it reacts normally with a variety of antisera and binds normally to GH receptors. IGF1 is low in GHIS, and exogenous GH does not induce an IGF1 response or restore normal growth. Plasma levels of GH-binding proteins (GHBP), which are derived from the extracellular domain of GHR, are often low. Cultured fibroblasts from patients with Laron dwarfism respond normally to serum growth factors (Cogan and Phillips, 2001).
Pertzelan et al. (1968) described a form of dwarfism in which the abnormality of pituitary hormones is limited to GH, but the level of GH as measured by the immunoassay method is high rather than low. In Israel, all cases (13 females, 7 males) of this type were in Oriental Jews. Laron (1974) listed a number of non-Jewish cases. Several of them were of Dutch or Arab extraction. Inheritance was clearly autosomal recessive. Similarly, Merimee et al. (1968) reported a 30-year-old man who had increased levels of plasma GH that were not suppressed by hyperglycemia and were further augmented by insulin-induced hypoglycemia and by arginine infusion. With respect to all metabolic indices examined, he showed attenuated responses to exogenous GH. Similarities to cases of isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) type I (see 262400) were exaggerated hypoglycemic response to exogenous insulin and insulinopenia after glucose or arginine. Also, Saldanha and Toledo (1981) reported 2 brothers who had apparent severe IGHD but high serum GH levels. These were born to first-cousin parents of possible Italian extraction.
In an inbred population of Spanish extraction in the province of Loja in southern Ecuador, Rosenbloom et al. (1990) studied 20 patients (2 to 49 years of age) with the clinical features of Laron syndrome. Seventeen patients were members of 2 large pedigrees; among 13 affected sibships there were 19 affected and 24 unaffected female sibs and 1 affected and 21 unaffected male sibs. The height of the patients ranged from 6.7 to 10.0 standard deviation (SD) below the normal mean height for age in the United States. In addition to the previously described features, 15 patients had limited elbow extensibility, all had blue sclerae, affected adults had relatively short limbs, and all 4 affected women over 30 years of age had hip degeneration. Acrohypoplasia, defined as hand or foot length below the tenth percentile for height, was noted in 80% of the patients. A high-pitched voice was present in both children and adults. The timing of menarche was moderately to markedly delayed in 5 of 12 women more than 16 years old. Basal serum concentrations of GH were elevated in all affected children and normal to moderately elevated in the adults. The serum level of GHBP ranged from 1 to 30% of normal. Reporting further on this Ecuadorian form of Laron syndrome, Guevara-Aguirre et al. (1991) described 47 patients; approximately 60 cases had been reported worldwide before 1990, half of them from Israel. Guevara-Aguirre et al. (1991) emphasized the occurrence of markedly advanced osseous maturation for height and age; normal body proportions in childhood but childlike proportions in adults; disproportionately greater deviation of stature than head size, giving an appearance of large cranium and small facies; blue sclerae; and limited elbow extension. Unlike the other large group of patients reported from Israel, the Ecuadorian patients were of normal or superior intelligence. Although phenotypically identical, the Ecuadorian patients from Loja province had a markedly skewed sex ratio (19 females:2 males) while those from the El Oro province had a normal sex distribution (14 females:12 males).
Rosenbloom et al. (1999) reviewed the clinical, endocrine, and molecular findings of affected members of this kindred in great detail. They noted that the kindred was descended from 'conversos,' Spanish Jews who became Catholic during the Inquisition.
Schaefer et al. (1994) used computerized image analysis to perform facial morphometrics on patients with Laron syndrome from Ecuador. Morphometrics were compared for 49 patients, 70 unaffected relatives, and 14 unrelated persons. Patients with growth hormone receptor deficiency showed significant decreases in measures of vertical facial growth as compared to unaffected relatives and unrelated persons with short stature from other causes. The findings validated and quantified the clinical impression of foreshortened facies in Laron syndrome.
Buchanan et al. (1991) described anomalous findings in a family from northern India in which 3 sisters had the phenotype of Laron syndrome. All members of the family had high-affinity serum GHBP activity similar in size, circulating levels, and apparent affinity for GH to that of normal subjects. The parents were not known to be consanguineous. Buchanan et al. (1991) concluded that some novel biochemical defect must be responsible for GH-resistance and reduced production of IGF1 in this family.
Goddard et al. (1995) broadened the phenotype of GHIS by demonstrating mutations in the GHR gene (600946.0006, 600946.0007, 600946.0008) in 4 of 14 children with idiopathic short stature selected on the basis of normal growth hormone secretion and low serum concentrations of GH-binding protein. Most children with idiopathic short stature respond to recombinant growth hormone treatment with increases in their growth rates (Hopwood et al., 1993). The report of Goddard et al. (1995) raised the question of whether mutations in the genes for IGF1 (147440), IGF-binding protein-3 (146732), or IGF1R may be involved in some cases of idiopathic short stature.
Woods et al. (1997) examined the phenotypic and biochemical features of 82 GHIS patients from 23 countries. There were 45 males and 37 females (mean age, 8.25 years; mean height, -6.09 SD score; and mean insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3; 146732) value, -7.99 SD score). Of these, 63 were GHBP negative and 19 were GHBP positive (greater than 10% binding). The mean heights of GHBP-negative and -positive subjects were -6.5 and -4.9 SD scores (P less than 0.001), respectively. Clinical and biochemical heterogeneity was seen in the wide range of height (-2.2 to -10.4 SD score) and IGFBP3 (-1.4 to -14.7 SD score) values, which were positively correlated (r(2) = 0.45; P less than 0.001). This contrasted with the lack of correlation between mean parental height SD score and height SD score (r(2) = 0.01). Fifteen different GHR mutations were identified in 27 patients. These mutations included 5 nonsense, 2 frameshift, 4 splice, and 4 missense. All patients except 1, a compound heterozygote, were homozygous. There was no relationship between mutation type or exon of the GHR gene involved and height or IGFBP3 SD score. Woods et al. (1997) concluded that GHIS is associated with wide variation in the severity of clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Since this variation cannot clearly be accounted for by defects in the GHR gene, they proposed that other genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the GHIS phenotype.
Ayling et al. (1997) described a 'new' category of congenital GHIS inherited as an autosomal dominant and caused by a dominant-negative mutation of the growth hormone receptor. There was no evidence of the phenotype usually associated with congenital GHIS (midfacial hypoplasia, blue sclera, limited elbow extension, sparse hair in childhood, or truncal adiposity). The patients studied were a mother and daughter. Sequencing of all GHR coding exons revealed a G-to-C transversion at position -1 of the splice acceptor site of intron 8 (600946.0015). The abnormality was not detected in the maternal grandparents, indicating a de novo mutation in the proband's mother. A signal peptide and extracellular sequence of the GHR gene are encoded by exons 2 to 7 and the transmembrane domain by most of exon 8. The intracellular sequence is encoded by a small part of exon 8, together with exons 9 and 10. RT-PCR with primers located in exons 8 and 10 produced 2 bands of approximately 290 and 220 bp, suggesting that the mutation caused deletion of exon 9. This was confirmed by sequencing. The predicted consequence of the exon skipping was a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon so that the cytoplasmic sequence of the mutant GHR would be reduced to only 7 amino acids. The GHR belongs to the cytokine superfamily of receptors that depend on JAK tyrosine kinases (see 147795) for activation of STATs (see 600555) and other signaling pathways. Association of JAK2 (147796) with the GHR requires a conserved proline-rich sequence encoded by exon 9, which is located in the cytoplasmic domain. Cotransfection of the mutant and wildtype GHR together with a reporter gene containing STAT5 (601511) binding sites showed that the mutant GHR was unable to activate STAT5. More importantly, the truncated receptor exerted a marked dominant-negative effect on GHR. Ayling et al. (1997) noted that ligand-induced dimerization of GHR is essential for signal transduction, and immunoprecipitation after cotransfecting cells with both forms of GHR showed that the wildtype and mutant forms heterodimerize. A specific cytoplasmic residue is necessary for internalization and degradation of the receptor, and this process is also dependent on ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic domain. Lacking these sequences, the mutant receptors would be expected to accumulate at the cell surface, reinforcing their dominant-negative effect. Overexpression of the mutant allele was also observed and appeared to contribute to the dominant-negative effect. Most previously identified mutations had been located in the extracellular hormone-binding domain of GHR, with consequent decrease in serum GH-binding protein (which is derived from this region of the receptor). The heterozygous mutations found by Goddard et al. (1995) as an apparent contributing factor to the problem in children with 'idiopathic' short stature and low GHBP were also located in the extracellular domain. An important implication of the study by Ayling et al. (1997) was that dominant GHR mutations should be sought in children who would not previously have been thought to have endocrinopathy, namely those with familial short stature and normal GHBP.



ROR2
**Brachydactyly, type B1, 113000 (3), AD**
Type B1 brachydactyly (BDB1) is the most severe type of human brachydactyly, and shows high penetrance and variable expressivity. Hypoplastic or absent distal phalanges and nails of digits 2 through 5 in the hands and feet are cardinal phenotypic features of BDB1. The middle phalanges of digits 2 through 5 are usually short and may form a bony fusion with the corresponding hypoplastic distal phalanges. The deformed thumbs are often flat, broad, or bifid. A rarer feature of BDB1 is cutaneous syndactyly affecting both fingers and toes (summary by Lv et al., 2009).
Involvement of the distal phalanges and the association of nail aplasia distinguishes type B brachydactyly, which is said (Gong et al., 1999) to have been the first of the heritable brachydactylies to be described in the medical literature (Kellie, 1808). In this form, as in the 4 A types, the middle phalanges are short but in addition the terminal phalanges are rudimentary or absent. Both fingers and toes are affected. The thumbs and big toes are usually deformed. This type of hand malformation presents the severest deformity in the brachydactyly group. Symphalangism is also a feature. There is also mild syndactyly between the digits, leading some authors to describe this deformity as symbrachydactyly. Syndactyly in the feet usually involves the second and third toes. MacKinder (1857) described this hand deformity in 6 generations. MacArthur and McCullough (1932) described the same deformity in 3 generations and preferred the term 'apical dystrophy.' Goeminne et al. (1970) observed affected persons in 5 generations. Lenz (1977) made brief reference (with photographs) to peripheral defects simulating amniogenic ('constriction band') defects but distinct from those and from type B brachydactyly. Five persons in 4 generations were affected. Failing penetrance was observed in 2 persons.
Lv et al. (2009) reported a large Chinese family in which multiple individuals had a severe form of type B brachydactyly showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Five affected individuals were studied in detail. The proband had hypoplastic distal phalanges of digits 2 through 5 of the hands and feet, and marked hypoplasia of the third toes. The 4 other affected individuals had bilateral syndactyly, marked hypoplastic distal phalanges and absent nails of fingers 2 and 5, and flat and broad thumbs. Three individuals had cutaneous syndactyly of fingers 3 and 4, 2 of whom also had toe syndactyly. Radiographic examination of the proband showed bifid distal phalanges of the thumbs, hypoplastic distal phalanges of fingers 2 and 4, with distal symphalangism of finger 2 and 3, absent distal phalanges of finger 5 and biphalangeal toes. Lv et al. (2009) commented on the unusual cutaneous syndactyly phenotype in this family. Genetic analysis identified a heterozygous mutation in the ROR2 gene (2243delC; 602337.0014).
**Robinow syndrome, autosomal recessive, 268310 (3), AR**
Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome-1 is a severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by dysmorphic facial features, including frontal bossing, hypertelorism, and broad nose, short-limbed dwarfism, vertebral segmentation, and genital hypoplasia (summary by van Bokhoven et al., 2000).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Robinow Syndrome
Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome-2 (RRS2; 618529) is caused by mutation in the NXN gene (612895) on chromosome 17p13.
See also autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome-1 (DRS1; 180700), caused by mutation in the WNT5A gene (164975) on chromosome 3p; DRS2 (616331), caused by mutation in the DVL1 gene (601365) on chromosome 1p36; and DRS3 (616894), caused by mutation in the DVL3 gene (601368) on chromosome 3q27.
A recessive form of Robinow syndrome was suggested by the reports of Wadia (1978, 1979) and Wadlington et al. (1973). Features common in both the dominant (180700) and recessive forms are the characteristic facial features, orodental abnormalities, and hypoplastic genitalia. Bain et al. (1986) suggested that the main discriminating feature is the occurrence of multiple rib and vertebral anomalies in the recessive form. Robinow (1987) suggested that the term COVESDEM syndrome be removed from the literature to avoid confusion of terminology. He suggested that the cases so designated represent a recessive form of Robinow syndrome.
Glaser et al. (1989) described Robinow syndrome in a child of a consanguineous Turkish couple. In addition to the 'fetal face' and mesomelic dwarfism of Robinow syndrome, the infant showed severe abnormalities of the vertebral column. Glaser et al. (1989) suggested that such changes in the vertebral column are particularly characteristic of the recessive form of Robinow syndrome. In 2 sibships related as first cousins and both with consanguineous parents, Teebi (1990) observed the features of autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome: short stature, mesomelic and acromelic brachymelia, characteristic face with hypertelorism, wide palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia and large mouth, and hypogenitalism. Nazer et al. (1990) reported 2 children, offspring of first-cousin Saudi parents, with the 'fetal face syndrome.' Both of the children also had the Crigler-Najjar syndrome, as did 2 previously born sibs who did not have the fetal face syndrome. Schorderet et al. (1992) described a brother and sister with Robinow syndrome in a Kurdish family from Turkey. The daughter had short stature, macrocephaly, hypertelorism, hepatosplenomegaly, short forearms, and marked vertebral anomalies. Her brother had hypertelorism, hypertrophied alveolar ridges, hepatosplenomegaly, short forearms, a rib anomaly, and ambiguous genitalia. The brother was mosaic for a Y-chromosome abnormality.
Balci et al. (1991) reported 14 patients, all but 1 of whom were the offspring of consanguineous marriages, and Robinow (1991) quoted Baxova of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, as suggesting that the condition is not rare in Czechoslovakia, where all cases occurred in the offspring of consanguineous gypsy parents (see Baxova et al., 1989). Robinow (1991) also had reports of recessive cases from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In addition, he pointed out that some cases thought to be of the dominant variety are probably cases of omodysplasia of Maroteaux (164745), including the 2 patients reported by Bain et al. (1986).
Balci et al. (1998) described a 14-year-old girl in whom the diagnosis of Robinow syndrome had been made at the age of 2 months by Balci et al. (1993) on the basis of fetal face, gingival hyperplasia, mesomelic shortness, hemivertebrae between T10 and L2 with scoliosis, and an extra hypoplastic right middle finger. Intravenous pyelogram showed calyectasia. At the age of 14 years, she had a history of recurrent severe abdominal pain for the previous 6 months. She had not yet experienced menarche. Hematocolpos related to vaginal atresia was discovered. She underwent vaginoplasty with cervical construction. Vaginal atresia with cervical agenesis had apparently not been observed previously in Robinow syndrome. This was thought to represent a recessive form of Robinow syndrome.
Aksit et al. (1997) reported 4 unrelated cases of Robinow syndrome, all with cardinal features of the condition, including vertebral and costal anomalies. In addition, 1 patient showed extensive webbing of the toes and an epigastric hernia. In 2 cases there was parental consanguinity. Sabry et al. (1997) reported 2 unrelated consanguineous families with Robinow syndrome. In a child of a Kuwaiti family, they reported associated intrauterine growth retardation; laxity of ligaments, joints, and skin; severe normocytic anemia; and repeated infection associated with increased total T cells and an increased CD4:CD8 ratio. In a child of a Pakistani family, there was associated congenital heart disease with right atrial isomerism, atrial and ventricular septal defects, double outlet right ventricle, and pulmonary stenosis.
Soliman et al. (1998) outlined the characteristics of recessive Robinow syndrome as follows: short stature, mesomelic and acromelic brachymelia, thick, abnormally modeled radius and ulna, characteristic face (with hypertelorism, wide palpebral fissures, broad-based nose, everted nares), large mouth, gum hypertrophy with irregular and crowded teeth, costovertebral anomalies, and micropenis in males. Endocrine dysfunction has also been observed. All children with the syndrome have been found to have empty sella. There is also partial insensitivity of Leydig cells to human chorionic gonadotropin (see 118860), low basal testosterone in prepubertal boys, and a defective sex-steroid feedback mechanism (Soliman et al., 1998).
Aksit et al. (1997) noted that of the 80 cases of Robinow syndrome reported to that time, 19 were born to Turkish couples, as were the 4 cases they reported.
Mazzeu et al. (2007) reported detailed clinical features of 37 and 51 patients with recessive and dominant Robinow syndrome, respectively. More than 75% of patients with either form had hypertelorism, large nasal bridge, short, upturned nose, midface hypoplasia, mesomelic limb shortening, brachydactyly, clinodactyly, micropenis, and short stature. Hemivertebrae and scoliosis were present in more than 75% of patients with the recessive form, but in less than 25% with the dominant form. Umbilical hernia (32%) and supernumerary teeth (10%) were found exclusively in patients with the dominant form.
Beiraghi et al. (2011) compared the craniofacial and intraoral phenotypes of 9 patients with dominant Robinow syndrome to 3 patients with recessive Robinow syndrome. Although there was overlap, particularly with regard to the most prevalent features such as hypertelorism, short, wide nose, and anteverted naries, the craniofacial dysmorphology was more severe in patients with the recessive disorder. In contrast, intraoral features were more severe in patients with the dominant disorder, and included wide retromolar ridge, alveolar ridge deformation, malocclusion, gingival enlargement, dental crowding, and hypodontia. In both types, facial characteristics became less pronounced in older individuals. Beiraghi et al. (2011) suggested that the differential diagnosis may be enhanced by noting differences in the alveolar ridge deformation pattern and severity of other intraoral characteristics.



TRAPPC9
**Mental retardation, autosomal recessive 13, 613192 (3), AR**
Mochida et al. (2009) reported a consanguineous Israeli Arab pedigree in which 3 girls had moderate to severe mental retardation and postnatal microcephaly. One girl, at age 7 years 10 months, had severe cognitive delay and could speak only a few words. She had normal motor development and could walk, but showed bruxism and hand-flapping movements. Brain MRI scans at age 2 and 4 years showed a thin corpus callosum and reduced volume of the cerebral white matter. Brain MRI of her 4-year-old affected sister also showed a thin but fully formed corpus callosum, decreased volume of the cerebral white matter, and hypoplasia of the inferior cerebellar vermis. Brain MRI was not reported for the third child. None of the patients had dysmorphic features, autistic features, or seizures, and there was no evidence of developmental regression.
Philippe et al. (2009) reported 3 brothers, born of consanguineous Tunisian parents, with autosomal recessive mental retardation associated with mild microcephaly, myelination defect, and truncal obesity in the first year of life. One child, first examined at age 10 years, had severe mental retardation with significant speech delay and a friendly personality. He had mild microcephaly, truncal obesity, hypertelorism, short neck, and prominent upper central incisors. Examination at age 19 showed progressive microcephaly and short, smooth philtrum, and brain MRI showed unusual white matter abnormalities. The second child had unilateral cleft lip, delayed speech, hypotelorism, short neck, prominent upper central incisors, short, smooth philtrum, and long, thin fingers. He understood simple commands and had a happy disposition and hyperactivity. The third affected child had global developmental delay, but was less severely affected. At age 4, he could communicate verbally with a few words and understood commands, and was able to performed simple tasks. He also had hyperactive behavior.
Mir et al. (2009) reported a consanguineous Pakistani family with MRT13. There was either microcephaly or borderline microcephaly. Three affected individuals were studied in detail. A 3-year-old girl did not walk independently and spoke fewer than 20 meaningful words. She could not feed herself and had not achieved continence. A 6-year-old girl started walking at 4 years of age, was overweight, could not use full sentences, and had clonic/tonic seizures. A 9-year-old boy started walking at 5 years of age and could communicate basic needs. There were no autistic features or dysmorphic features.
Abou Jamra et al. (2011) reported a large consanguineous Syrian family (MR055) with MRT13. The patients had neonatal hypotonia, severe motor delay with walking between ages 5 and 7 years, single words or no speech, growth retardation, stereotypic movements, and hand flapping. They also shared some dysmorphic features, including low frontal hairline, synophrys, and microcephaly. One patient had seizures. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous truncating mutation in the TRAPPC9 gene (611966.0001).
Marangi et al. (2013) reported 2 sisters, born of unrelated parents from southern Italy, with MRT13. Both had hypotonia at birth and showed delayed psychomotor development; 1 child never learned to stand up or utter single words. Both had a small head and a distinctive craniofacial appearance with brachycephaly, round face, hypertelorism, straight eyebrows, synophrys, wide nasal bridge, fleshy ears, and downturned mouth. One girl had recurrent febrile seizures. Both had abnormal brain MRI findings, including decreased cerebral white matter volume, sulcal enlargement, thinning of the corpus callosum, and reduced cerebellar volume. There were also several areas of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter. Both girls were obese and severely mentally disabled. One showed a friendly disposition. In a review of the literature, Marangi et al. (2013) concluded that the phenotype associated with loss-of-function mutations in the TRAPPC9 gene is recognizable and can be characterized by dysmorphic facial appearance, obesity, hypotonia, moderate to severe intellectual disability, and consistent brain abnormalities.



EYA1
**Branchiootic syndrome 1, 602588 (3), AD**
Individuals with the BO syndrome are affected by the same branchial and otic anomalies as those seen in individuals with the branchiootorenal syndrome (see BOR1, 113650), but lack renal anomalies (Vincent et al., 1997).
Although Melnick et al. (1978) maintained that the BO syndrome is distinct from the BOR syndrome because of the lack of renal anomalies and variable presence of deafness in the former, Cremers and Fikkers-van Noord (1980) suggested that the 2 syndromes represent a single entity.
See 113600 for a discussion of branchial cleft anomalies, which may be related.
Genetic Heterogeneity of Branchiootic Syndrome
See also BOS2 (120502), which maps to chromosome 1, and BOS3 (608389), which maps to 14q23 and is caused by mutations in the SIX1 gene (601205).
Fourman and Fourman (1955) described a large multigenerational family in which 17 members had preauricular pits, 12 of whom also had mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss. Among family members without preauricular pits, 3 had hearing loss: one of these individuals had a branchial pit. Some reported onset of hearing loss in childhood, whereas others had onset beginning at about age 20 years. Audiograms showed both high and low tone loss, usually high tone more than low. There was no evidence of vestibular disorder. The authors suggested that ear pits, deafness, and branchial fistulae were independent effects of a single dominant gene with incomplete penetrance.
Wildervanck (1962) reported a family in which 14 members had either deformed auricles, marginal pits, or preauricular appendages. Two had a moderate conductive deafness: bilateral in 1 and unilateral in the other. The mode of inheritance was dominant with full penetration. Wildervanck (1962) suggested this was a different syndrome from that described by Fourman and Fourman (1955). McLaurin et al. (1966) reported a kindred with branchial anomalies and associated hearing impairment similar to the kindred described by Wildervanck (1962). Brusis (1974) reported a kindred similar to the one described by Fourman and Fourman (1955).
Vincent et al. (1997) reported 2 families with the BO syndrome. Clinical features included branchial cervical fistulae, cup-shaped pinnae, preauricular pits, and sensorineural, conductive, or mixed hearing loss. There was no evidence of renal anomalies.
Spruijt et al. (2006) reported an infant with severe obstructive sleep apnea caused by laryngomalacia, pharyngomalacia, glossoptosis, and tracheobronchomalacia. He also had bilateral branchial fistulae and ear anomalies, including ear pits, simple helices, and slight cup-shaped and low-set left ear. The features suggested BO syndrome. Other findings included micro- and retrognathia, but kidneys and hearing were normal. Surgical intervention improved the upper airway obstruction, but mild delay and mental and motor development were observed at age 11 months. His mildly affected mother showed mild retrognathia, left-sided branchial neck fistula, left-sided preauricular pit, and right-sided branchial cyst in the neck. Kidney ultrasound and hearing were normal. Both mother and son were heterozygous for a truncating mutation in the EYA1 gene (601653.0015). Spruijt et al. (2006) emphasized the phenotypic variability of BO syndrome associated with EYA1 mutations.
**Branchiootorenal syndrome 1, with or without cataracts, 113650 (3), AD**
Branchiootorenal syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by sensorineural, conductive, or mixed hearing loss, structural defects of the outer, middle, and inner ear, branchial fistulas or cysts, and renal abnormalities ranging from mild hypoplasia to complete absence. Reduced penetrance and variable expressivity has been observed (Fraser et al., 1978).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Branchiootorenal Syndrome
See also BOR2 (610896), caused by mutation in the SIX5 gene (600963) on chromosome 19q13. Sanchez-Valle et al. (2010) stated that approximately 40% of patients with BOR have mutations in the EYA1 gene and 5% have mutations in the SIX5 gene.
See also branchiootic (BO) syndrome-1 (BOS1; 602588) and the otofaciocervical syndrome (OFC; 166780), allelic disorders showing overlapping phenotypes but without renal anomalies. See also 600257 for a discussion of the BOR-Duane-hydrocephalus contiguous gene syndrome as described by Vincent et al. (1994).
Although Melnick et al. (1978) maintained that the BOR syndrome is distinct from the BO syndrome because in the latter condition renal anomaly is absent and deafness is not a constant feature, Cremers and Fikkers-van Noord (1980) concluded that the 2 syndromes are in fact a single entity.
Melnick et al. (1975, 1976) described a family in which the father and 3 of 6 living children (a son and 2 daughters) had mixed hearing loss associated with a Mondini-type cochlear malformation (hypoplasia of cochlear apex shown by tomography) and stapes fixation, cup-shaped, anteverted pinnae, bilateral prehelical pits, bilateral branchial cleft fistulas, and bilateral renal dysplasia with anomalies of the collecting system. The father and affected son also had aplasia of the lacrimal ducts. A fourth child, who died at 5 months of age, was said to have had branchial cleft fistulas and bilateral polycystic kidneys. Conditions in the same nosoembryologic community were discussed. Fitch and Srolovitz (1976) reported a woman with preauricular pits, cervical fistulas, and partial deafness who gave birth to 2 children with preauricular pits and severe renal dysgenesis.
Fraser et al. (1978) reported a kindred with the BOR syndrome. Clinical features included preauricular pits, branchial fistulas, sensorineural, conductive, or mixed hearing loss, lacrimal stenosis, and malformed external ears. Radiographic studies showed hypoplastic and malformed external ear canals, ossicles, and cochlea. Radiographic studies of the urinary tract showed minor anomalies, including partially distorted pelvicalyceal systems, narrow pelviureteric junctions, and renal dysplasia. Not all features were expressed in those affected. Fraser et al. (1978) also provided a review of previously reported cases.
Carmi et al. (1983) observed a man with the BOR syndrome and crossed renal ectopia who fathered 3 children born with bilateral renal agenesis and the Potter syndrome. Preisch et al. (1985) reported affected father, son, and daughter. The father and daughter showed unilateral tearing with eating, i.e., gustatory lacrimation. Another family reportedly showed the same phenomenon. Gustatory lacrimation, sometimes described as 'crocodile tears,' was noted by Gorlin (1976) to have been observed in over 100 cases but never in multiple members of families. Most cases are unilateral and often follow facial trauma or surgery but can occur as a congenital defect in innervation.
Fraser et al. (1983) reported 2 families in which the propositi had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, preauricular pit or tag, and duplication of the ureters or bifid renal pelvises. Other relatives had 1 or more of these anomalies in a pattern suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Fraser et al. (1983) suggested the term 'branchiootoureteral syndrome.'
Heimler and Lieber (1986) described a large, 4-generation kindred with branchiootorenal syndrome containing 16 individuals with confirmed manifestations of the disorder. Of these, only 4 had abnormalities in all 3 systems, whereas 7 had branchial arch and/or hearing defects but no reported renal abnormalities. However, because only 1 of these individuals had undergone detailed renal evaluation, it is possible that the incidents of renal defects in this kindred was higher than reported.
Legius et al. (1990) described father and son with a branchial cleft syndrome mixing characteristics of the BOR syndrome with those of the branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS; 113620). The 2 subjects showed several anomalies common to both syndromes, namely, abnormally shaped ears with deafness, cervical fistulas, preauricular ear pits, and lacrimal duct stenosis. Unilateral renal hypoplasia and dysplasia in the son were typical of the BOR syndrome. On the other hand, cleft palate and mild 'mental problems' in the father, and bilateral microphthalmia and high-arched palate in the son were more characteristic of BOFS. Neither the father nor the son showed the usual findings of BOFS, such as lip 'pseudoclefts,' abnormal nose, premature graying, or skin abnormalities. The father had been operated on for arteria lusoria (left subclavian artery passing behind the esophagus) causing dysphagia. He had also had unexplained atrial fibrillation. Lin et al. (1992) concluded that the patients of Legius et al. (1990) indeed had the BOF syndrome and that this entity is distinct from the BOR syndrome. Legius and Fryns (1992) remained dubious of a distinction.
Chitayat et al. (1992) made the diagnosis of BOR syndrome in a woman who had had 2 pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios due to renal hypoplasia and agenesis. Both babies died neonatally of pulmonary hypoplasia. Histopathology of the temporal bones of the second child showed marked immaturity of the middle ear cleft, ossicles, facial nerve and canal, and cochlear nerve. The mother's renal ultrasound study was normal although intravenous pyelography indicated renal hypoplasia. The mother had a hearing problem first recognized at age 5 when abnormality of the right ossicular mass and antral region was found. A preauricular pit on the right in the mother was pictured.
Chen et al. (1995) described 45 individuals with the BOR syndrome, highlighting differences and similarities to findings reported by others. Characteristic temporal bone findings included hypoplasia of the cochlea, which was four-fifths of normal size with only 2 turns, dilation of the vestibular aqueduct, bulbous internal auditory canals, deep posterior fossa, and acutely angled promontories. They pictured a 3-generation family with various manifestations.
Graham and Allanson (1999) described a 14-month-old girl with unilateral congenital cholesteatoma (604183) and anomalies of the facial nerve, in addition to the branchial arch, otic, and renal malformations that comprise the BOR syndrome. The mother also had the BOR syndrome and unilateral duplication of the facial nerve. This was said to be the first study of a BOR patient with congenital cholesteatoma and the second family in which cholesteatoma and anomalies of the facial nerve were described in patients with BO/BOR syndrome.
In the branchiootorenal syndrome, renal defects, which are estimated to be severe in only 6% of patients, can include collecting system duplication, hypoplasia, cystic dysplasia, hydronephrosis, and agenesis (Izzedine et al., 2004).
Olavarrieta et al. (2008) reported an unusual Spanish family in which the male proband had BOR1 syndrome, associated with a heterozygous de novo mutation in the EYA1 gene (601653.0015), and Stickler syndrome type I (STL1; 108300), associated with a heterozygous mutation in the COL2A1 gene (120140). The patient's mother and brother, both of whom had Stickler syndrome and the COL2A1 mutation, did not carry the EYA1 mutation. All 3 patients had myopia, vitreous anomaly, and flat face, characteristic of Stickler syndrome; the brothers had cleft palate. The proband also had branchial fistulas, preauricular pits, renal agenesis, and mixed hearing loss consistent with BOR1 syndrome. The brother with Stickler syndrome had conductive hearing loss due to infection and surgery. Olavarrieta et al. (2008) emphasized that both disorders show phenotypic variability as well as overlapping features, which can complicate a precise diagnosis. Thorough clinical evaluation is necessary to identify coexisting genetic syndromes in the same patient.
**?Otofaciocervical syndrome, 166780 (3), AD**
Otofaciocervical syndrome (OTFCS) is a rare disorder characterized by facial anomalies, cup-shaped low-set ears, preauricular fistulas, hearing loss, branchial defects, skeletal anomalies including vertebral defects, low-set clavicles, winged scapulae, sloping shoulders, and mild intellectual disability (summary by Pohl et al., 2013).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Otofaciocervical Syndrome
OTFCS2 (615560) is caused by mutation in the PAX1 gene (167411) on chromosome 20p11.
Otofaciocervical syndrome was described by Fara et al. (1967) in a man and 4 of his 7 children. The otologic features were conductive hearing loss and prominent auricles with large conchae and preauricular fistulas just in front of the helix. Lateral cervical fistulas were present in some. Sunken nasal root, narrow nose, and long face were striking. The neck appeared long with sloping shoulders, low-set clavicles, and winged scapulae. All showed a mild intellectual deficit. Gorlin (1982) stated that this was the only known kindred with this disorder.
Dallapiccola and Mingarelli (1995) presented a sporadic case which they suggested supports the distinctness of the otofaciocervical syndrome. Distinguishing features were a long face with narrow nose, highly arched palate, prominent and dysmorphic ears, long neck, sloping shoulders and clavicles, winged, low and laterally set scapulae, tetralogy of Fallot, and deafness secondary to cochlea malformation. Several features present in the original family, including lateral cervical fistulae, had suggested that otofaciocervical syndrome is a variant of branchiootorenal syndrome (BOR; 113650). The absence of preauricular tags, lacrimal duct stenosis, and renal malformations, and the presence of distinct facial and radiographic findings and markedly downward sloping shoulders in their patient led Dallapiccola and Mingarelli (1995) to suggest that the syndrome is a unique, clinically recognizable entity.
Rickard et al. (2001) presented evidence that the otofaciocervical syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving the EYA1 gene, which is the site of mutations causing the branchiootorenal syndrome. One of the 2 patients they studied had previously been reported by Rajput et al. (1999). She presented with moderate hearing loss, bilateral preauricular pits, a single lacrimal duct, a cup-shaped ear, and unilateral facial palsy. A congenital cholesteatoma was identified in her right middle ear and was treated surgically. She was of short stature and had a short neck and pronounced sloping shoulders, with limited shoulder abduction. X-rays showed lateral displaced scapulae. She had mild developmental delay. A renal ultrasound showed a small left kidney and a right kidney of normal size with a bifid pelvis. Both parents were unaffected and intellectually normal.



SLC25A24
**Fontaine progeroid syndrome, 612289 (3), AD**
Fontaine progeroid syndrome is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, decreased subcutaneous fat tissue, sparse hair, triangular face, widely open anterior fontanel, convex and broad nasal ridge, micrognathia, craniosynostosis in some patients, and early death in many (summary by Writzl et al., 2017).
Petty et al. (1990) described what they considered to be a newly recognized form of congenital progeroid syndrome in a 5-year-old girl. They suggested that the 46-year-old woman reported by Wiedemann (1979) had the same syndrome. Common manifestations included pre- and postnatal growth retardation, markedly diminished subcutaneous fat, wrinkled skin, abnormally scant hair growth, hypoplastic distal phalanges with hypoplastic nails, umbilical hernia, large open anterior fontanel, and normal cognitive and motor development. Both patients had a prematurely aged appearance since birth. Petty et al. (1990) noted that patients with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WRS; 264090) show similarities to their patient, but differ by the presence of natal teeth, large hands and feet with long, tapering digits, developmental delay, and neurologic impairment.
Rodriguez et al. (1999) reported a severe prenatal form of progeria. Marked intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and oligohydramnios had been detected at 32 weeks' gestation by ultrasonography, and the patient was born by cesarean section at 35 weeks. She died 7 hours after birth with features including premature aging, absence of subcutaneous fat, brachydactyly, absent nipples, hypoplastic external genitalia, and abnormal ear lobes. The authors designated this case as a prenatal form of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670). However, Faivre et al. (1999) reported a similarly affected female neonate and stated that HGPS was an 'inappropriate' diagnosis for both their own patient and the patient reported by Rodriguez et al. (1999). Despite some overlap in clinical manifestations, Faivre et al. (1999) also thought it unlikely that their infant had WRS, also known as neonatal progeroid syndrome. Rodriguez and Perez-Alonso (1999) defended the 'diagnosis of progeria syndrome [as] the only one possible.'
Castori et al. (2009) described a male infant born with marked IUGR and oligohydramnios, for which he was delivered by cesarean section at 32 weeks' gestation. At birth he was cyanotic and hypotonic, with severe respiratory distress, and he died at 20 hours after birth from cardiopulmonary failure. Postmortem examination showed brachycephaly, wide anterior fontanel, hypertelorism, midface hypoplasia with depressed periorbital area, short nose with broad base and anteverted nares, and low-set ears with flattened helix. There was a generalized deficiency of subcutaneous fat, and his scalp hair showed an unusual distribution, being sparse in the parietal area bilaterally. The digits of all 4 limbs were shortened and markedly tapered with nail hypoplasia/aplasia. Abdominal muscles were severely hypoplastic and the overlying skin was mildly redundant. In addition, he had micropenis, hypoplasia of the scrotum, and bilateral cryptorchidism. X-ray showed synostotic brachycephaly due to premature fusion of the coronal sutures, universal platyspondyly with superior and inferior notching of multiple vertebral bodies, and hypoplasia/aplasia of the distal phalanx of all digits. Dissection revealed pachygyria and cerebellar hypoplasia, as well as intestinal malrotation and multiple volvuli. Noting the triad of craniosynostosis, anonychia, and extensive abdominal muscle hypoplasia in this patient, the authors concluded that the disorder was consistent with what they designated 'Fontaine-Farriaux syndrome.'
Adolphs et al. (2011) reported a 7-year-old Hungarian girl with GCMS who underwent frontofacial advancement by internal distraction for functional and psychosocial amelioration of her complex craniofacial malformation. In addition to brachycephaly with severe midface hypoplasia and retrusion, she had short eyebrows and palpebral fissures, hypertrichosis of the scalp and trunk with low frontal hairline, hyperopia, dental anomalies, and hypoplasia of the labia majora, and she was given a diagnosis of Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome. Her postoperative course was complicated by a necrotizing soft tissue infection of the scalp.
Ehmke et al. (2017) studied 5 unrelated girls, including the Hungarian girl previously reported by Adolphs et al. (2011) (patient 2), who all exhibited brachycephaly, broad forehead, depressed supraorbital ridge, midface hypoplasia, prognathia or tongue protrusion, low anterior and posterior hairlines, hypertrichosis, and wrinkled skin. Other features included large anterior fontanel, coarse scalp hair, short downslanting palpebral fissures, and low-set dysplastic ears. All had failure to thrive, and 4 of the 5 showed IUGR and postnatal short stature, with reduced subcutaneous fat tissue and dermal translucency. In addition, 4 exhibited coronal craniosynostosis, oligodontia and/or microdontia, and small nails; short distal phalanges and syndactyly were also present in 3, and 3 had conductive hearing impairment. Four had umbilical hernia, and 2 also had hypoplasia of the abdominal wall muscles. Four of the 5 patients were alive at ages 5, 5.5, 7, and 14 years, but a Turkish girl (patient 4) died at 20 months after a urinary tract infection. Two of the girls had initially been diagnosed with neonatal progeroid syndrome (WRS), but the authors stated that the 5 girls showed the typical hallmarks of GCMS.
Writzl et al. (2017) studied 2 boys and 2 girls with a progeroid appearance. The 2 girls were previously reported by Rodriguez et al. (1999) (patient 3) and Faivre et al. (1999) (patient 2), and 1 of the boys was reported by Castori et al. (2009) (patient 4). All presented with pre- and postnatal growth retardation as well as an aged appearance characterized by decreased subcutaneous fat, wrinkled skin, and prominent veins. Other features included wide fontanels, abnormal scalp hair pattern, triangular face, midface hypoplasia, convex nasal ridge, micrognathia, low-set dysplastic ears, small distal phalanges, and small nails. Umbilical hernia was present in 2 patients, and another had abdominal muscle hypoplasia. Cryptorchidism was present in both boys, and 1 also had micropenis and hypoplastic scrotum. Two patients had craniosynostosis, with premature fusion of coronal sutures in both and parietotemporal synostosis in 1. All 4 patients died within the first year of life: patients 3 and 4 from respiratory distress, at 7 hours and 20 hours after birth, respectively; patient 1 from pulmonary hypertension at age 6 months; and patient 2 from sepsis at age 7 months. For historic reasons, the authors designated the congenital progeroid disorder in these patients as Fontaine syndrome, noting that a similarly affected patient was first described by Fontaine et al. (1977); Writzl et al. (2017) also stated that the phenotype was likely to represent the same entity as that described by Petty et al. (1990).



MYT1L
**Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 39, 616521 (3), AD**
De Rocker et al. (2015) described 2 unrelated patients with MRD39. Patient 14, originally reported by de Ligt et al. (2012), was a girl who presented with neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties soon after birth, and was noted to have developmental delay around 6 months of age. At age 12 years, she had an IQ of about 45 and showed autistic features. Mild dysmorphic features included broad base and bridge of the nose and a large mouth. Patient 15 was a 13-year-old boy with delayed development, especially affecting language, and autism spectrum disorder. At age 9 years, his IQ was about 50. He had brachycephaly and upwardly slanted narrow eyes.
Blanchet et al. (2017) reported 9 patients with MRD39. All had developmental delay or impaired intellectual development and gross motor delay. Most (85%) were overweight/obese and 70% had hyperphagia. CNS malformation and minor anomalies were each seen in 42% of patients. Autism and epilepsy were seen in 30% and 15% of patients, respectively. The proportions with impaired intellectual development, gross motor delay, speech delay, autism, overweight/obesity, and hyperphagia among patients with MYT1L haploinsufficiency were similar to those in patients with the 2p25.3 deletion syndrome, suggesting that MTY1L haplosufficiency is responsible for the 2p25.3 deletion phenotype.
Loid et al. (2018) reported a 13-year-old boy with MRD39 with early-onset obesity. The patient was overweight at age 1 year and obese at age 2 years. He had hyperphagia, speech delay, strabismus, hyperactivity, and neurologic, cognitive, and motor delay. The patient had no dysmorphic features, and his brain MRI was normal.



DPP6
**Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 33, 616311 (3)**
Liao et al. (2013) reported a family with 4 affected members in 3 generations segregating autosomal dominant mental retardation. All 4 affected individuals had microcephaly (greater than -3 SD): a 56-year-old male with a head circumference of 51 cm, a 26-year-old female with a head circumference of 50 cm, a 29-year-old female with a head circumference of 50 cm, and a 5-year-old girl with a head circumference of 44 cm. One woman and her 5-year-old daughter were both small and thin (stature and weight -2 to -3 SD in both); an affected aunt had normal stature, and the grandfather had short stature, with a height of 163 cm. The proband had severe mental retardation and hyperactivity. The mother had microcephaly and mild mental retardation with an IQ of 65. The aunt had severe mental retardation and memory problems. The grandfather had mild mental retardation, with an IQ of 66.
**{Ventricular fibrillation, paroxysmal familial, 2}, 612956 (3), AD**
Alders et al. (2009) studied 4 families segregating idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) who came from the same area in the Netherlands and were genealogically linked through multiple lines. The proband in the first family came to medical attention because of the death of one of her brothers at age 31 in the early morning. Postmortem examination did not reveal cause of death or cardiac anomalies. Her sister died suddenly at the age of 31 at night. She had undergone complete cardiac examination that was unremarkable one month before her death. Cardiac evaluation of the proband did not reveal any abnormalities. However, 6 months after that examination she suffered ventricular fibrillation at age 44 and was successfully resuscitated. Implantation of an ICD followed and it had not discharged in the follow-up period of 2.5 years. The proband's nephew was resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation at age 16 years. He had an ICD implanted and it discharged appropriately several times over the next 2 years after his first event. The second family came to medical attention because the proband lost 2 children, 1 at the age of 37 at rest and the other at age 32 during sleep. In both cases there was no evidence of cardiac disease. The proband considered himself to be an obligate carrier because 3 sibs of his mother had died suddenly at young ages. He had complete cardiac evaluation that was unremarkable. In the third family, the proband was admitted to the hospital after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation at the age of 33 years. His cardiac examination was normal but an ICD was implanted. During follow-up for 4 years, he had several appropriate discharges. Two sons of his great-grandmother had died suddenly at age 30.
Alders et al. (2009) identified a risk haplotype in these 3 families and in 7 other families from the Netherlands segregating IVF. They evaluated the clinical consequences of carrying the risk haplotype in a total of 155 relatives from the 10 families. Eighty-four of these individuals (54%) were identified as carriers of the risk haplotype. None of them had any echocardiographic or cardiac MRI abnormalities. All had normal EKGs. Among those individuals who were resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation, their electrophysiologic studies or ICD reports showed short-coupled isolated monomorphic extrasystoles, occasionally eliciting immediate ventricular fibrillation. Median survival in risk-haplotype carriers was 58 years (95% CI, 46-69 years). Thirty risk-haplotype carriers experienced a clinical event; 19, unexplained sudden cardiac death; and 11, resuscitated ventricular fibrillation. The youngest individual experiencing an event was 16 years of age, and the oldest was 77 years of age. The mean age at event was 36 +/- 13 years. Males were overrepresented in this group; they had 23 events, whereas there were 7 events in females.



NEB
**Nemaline myopathy 2, autosomal recessive, 256030 (3), AR**
Nemaline myopathy-2 is an autosomal recessive skeletal muscle disorder with a wide range of severity. The most common clinical presentation is early-onset (in infancy or childhood) muscle weakness predominantly affecting proximal limb muscles. Muscle biopsy shows accumulation of Z-disc and thin filament proteins into aggregates named 'nemaline bodies' or 'nemaline rods,' usually accompanied by disorganization of the muscle Z discs. The clinical and histologic spectrum of entities caused by variants in the NEB gene is a continuum, ranging in severity from the severe form with perinatal onset and fetal death to milder forms with later onset. The distribution of weakness can vary from generalized muscle weakness, more pronounced in proximal limb muscles, to distal-only involvement, although neck flexor weakness appears to be rather consistent. Histologic patterns range from a severe usually nondystrophic disturbance of the myofibrillar pattern to an almost normal pattern, with or without nemaline bodies, sometimes combined with cores (summary by Lehtokari et al., 2014).
For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of nemaline myopathy, see NEM3 (161800).
Mutations in the NEB gene are the most common cause of nemaline myopathy (Lehtokari et al., 2006).
Wallgren-Pettersson et al. (1999) reported 41 unrelated families with NEM2 suggested by linkage analysis. All were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. Wallgren-Pettersson et al. (1999) noted that phenotypic classification of nemaline myopathy is difficult because the disease spectrum forms a continuum; however, the authors described 2 main forms, 'typical' and 'severe.' Typical patients had generalized hypotonia at birth, with particular involvement of the bulbar, neck flexor, and respiratory muscles. Proximal limb muscles were weaker initially, but distal limb muscle weakness eventually occurred. The extraocular muscles were spared. The facies was myopathic with a high-arched palate. The spine was hyperlordotic, sometimes rigid, and scoliosis sometimes developed at puberty. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased or absent, and the gag reflex was often absent. Chest deformities were common, but there was no cardiac involvement. Imaging showed decreased muscle density with increased fatty infiltration. Serum creatine kinase was normal or mildly elevated. Muscle biopsies characteristically showed nemaline bodies and type 1 fiber predominance. Although myopathic changes were observed, there were no dystrophic or inflammatory changes. Despite delayed motor development and waddling gait, many patients with typical disease remained ambulatory as adults. Intelligence was normal. A subset of patients had severe disease, characterized by absence of spontaneous movements or respiration at birth. These patients often had contractures or fractures at birth and usually never achieved independent sitting or ambulation.
Wallgren-Pettersson et al. (2002) reported 7 patients from 5 families with severe NEM2 confirmed by mutation in the NEB gene. Four pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios, and 4 patients had arthrogryposis. Most affected infants did show show spontaneous respiration or antigravity movements. Several previous infant deaths or miscarriages were reported in the families. Two affected brothers in 1 family had large fontanels, low-set ears, adducted thumbs, hypospadias, and micropenis. Another affected child had cleft palate, rocker-bottom feet, and undescended testes. Death occurred between 30 minutes and 19 months of age. Muscle biopsies showed nemaline bodies in up to 90% of muscle fibers.
Romero et al. (2009) reported a 27-year-old man with NEM2 confirmed by genetic analysis. He presented at birth with generalized hypotonia, poor spontaneous movements, and restrictive respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. He showed diffuse muscle weakness with axial predominance, never acquired independent ambulation, and developed multiple joint contractures. As an adult, he was quadriplegic with mild facial weakness. No cardiac symptoms were observed. Muscle biopsy showed numerous fibers with distinctive rods and well-delineated cores in type 1 fibers. Electron microscopy showed rods with characteristic striation and cores with some sarcomeric disorganization and depletion of mitochondria. The histologic findings indicated that cores, in addition to rods, may be found in patients with NEM2.
In a detailed review and update of 159 families with mutations in the nebulin gene associated with myopathies, Lehtokari et al. (2014) noted that the most common associated phenotype was nemaline myopathy (90% of families). Within this broad category, there was a range of severity. In addition, some families with NEB mutations had more diverse manifestations, including early-onset distal myopathy without nemaline bodies (4 families), a distal form of nemaline myopathy (3 families), core-rod myopathy with generalized muscle weakness (3 families), a childhood-onset distal myopathy with rods and cores (3 families), and fetal akinesia/lethal multiple pterygium syndrome (3 families).
Fetal Akinesia/Lethal Multiple Pterygia Syndrome
Yonath et al. (2012) reported 4 unrelated pregnancies with abnormal prenatal ultrasound findings in fetuses with NEM2. In each family, 1 or both of the parents was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the common exon 55 deletion (161650.0007) in the NEB gene was found in the heterozygous state in the patients and in unaffected parents. A second pathogenic NEB mutation was found in 3 of the patients; a second mutation could not be identified in 1 of the patients. Prenatal ultrasound showed polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movements, clubfoot, and clenched hands. All patients showed severe hypotonia after birth, and all died within the first months of life.
Todd et al. (2015) reported twin male fetuses, conceived of consanguineous parents, with NEM2 presenting as fetal akinesia with lethal multiple pterygia syndrome. Prenatal ultrasound showed severe hydrops in both fetuses, and the pregnancy was terminated at 16 weeks' gestation. Postmortem examination showed joint contractures consistent with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), bilateral talipes, multiple pterygia, hypertelorism, and cystic hygromas. Muscle tissue was not obtained. A previous fetus was therapeutically aborted due to hydrops fetalis at 19 weeks' gestation.
Abdalla et al. (2017) reported 2 male fetuses, conceived of consanguineous Egyptian parents, with NEM2 presenting as fetal akinesia with lethal multiple pterygia syndrome. Both pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios and hydrops fetalis. Prenatal ultrasound of the second fetus at 18 weeks' gestation showed growth restriction, fetal akinesia, cystic hygroma, edema, pericardial effusion, hydrothorax, and flexion deformities. The pregnancy was terminated, and postmortem examination confirmed the findings of multiple pterygia and contractures; dysmorphic features, including hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, and low-set ears were also noted. Muscle biopsy was not performed.
Distal Myopathy
Wallgren-Pettersson et al. (2007) reported 7 patients from 4 unrelated Finnish families with NEM2 presenting as distal myopathy with foot drop between the first and third decades after normal early motor development. Muscle weakness predominantly affected the ankle dorsiflexors, finger extensors, and neck flexors, resulting in walking difficulties and increased falls in some patients. The patients were unable to walk on their heels. Additional variable features included high-arched palate, slight facial weakness, dysarthria, pseudohypertrophy of the calves, and mild atrophy of proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. Radiographic imaging showed fatty replacement of the muscles of the anterior compartment of the lower legs. None of the patients had breathing problems or dysphagia, and serum creatine kinase was not elevated. Muscle biopsy showed myopathic changes with marked fiber size variability, fibrosis, and large hypertrophic fibers with increased internal nuclei. Rare nemaline rods or bodies were observed, although these were often apparent only on electron microscopy or with special staining. The patients were initially thought to have tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD; 600334), but molecular analysis excluded that diagnosis.



SLC20A2
**Basal ganglia calcification, idiopathic, 1, 213600 (3), AD**
Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by symmetric calcification in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. Patients with calcifications can either be asymptomatic or show a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, ataxia, dementia, psychosis, seizures, and chronic headache. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone are normal. The typical age at clinical onset is between 30 and 50 years (summary by Wang et al., 2012).
Calcification of the basal ganglia is a nonspecific finding in many medical conditions, including infectious, metabolic, and genetic syndromes. In addition, calcification of the basal ganglia is observed as an incidental finding in approximately 0.7 to 1.2% of CT scans (Koller et al., 1979; Harrington et al., 1981; Forstl et al., 1992). These incidental calcifications are usually benign and have no clear etiology, especially in patients over 60 years of age (Geschwind et al., 1999). Forstl et al. (1992) found no increased risk for dementia, cerebral infarction, seizures, alcoholism, vertigo, or headache in 166 patients with calcification of the basal ganglia compared to 622 individuals without calcification.
Genetic Heterogeneity of Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification
See IBGC4 (615007), caused by mutation in the PDGFRB gene (173410) on 5q32; IBGC5 (615483), caused by mutation in the PDGFB gene (190040) on 22q13; IBGC6 (616413), caused by mutation in the XPR1 gene (605237) on 1q25; IBGC7 (618317), caused by mutation in the MYORG gene (618255) on 9p13; and IBGC8 (618824), caused by mutation in the JAM2 gene (606870) on 21q21.
See 114100 for a childhood-onset form of idiopathic basal ganglia calcification.
The symbol IBGC3 previously referred to the locus on chromosome 8p11 that includes the SLC20A2 gene (Dai et al., 2010). However, the family that originally defined the putative IBGC1 locus on chromosome 14q (Geschwind et al., 1999) was later found to carry a pathogenic mutation in the SLC20A2 gene (Hsu et al., 2013), and the IBGC locus on chromosome 14q has not been replicated (Oliveira et al., 2004; Hsu et al., 2013). Thus, the symbol IBGC1 now refers to the disorder caused by mutation in the SLC20A2 gene on chromosome 8p11 and the symbol IBGC3 is no longer used. In addition, the symbol IBGC2 was previously used for a form of IBGC erroneously mapped to 2q37; the family in which this linkage was reported by Volpato et al. (2009) was later found by Grutz et al. (2016) to have a mutation in the SLC20A2 gene and thus to have IBGC1.
Foley (1951) reported a family in which calcification of the corpus striatum and dentate nuclei was inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Matthews (1957) and Schafroth (1958) reported affected families. Roberts (1959) reported a family with 6 affected persons in 2 generations, including an instance of male-to-male transmission. Two patients appeared refractory to the PTH-phosphaturic test, and 1 patient had low serum calcium, but the other patients had normal serum calcium. Roberts (1959) suggested a relation to PHP, but Moskowitz et al. (1971) concluded the family had familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcifications.
Pilleri (1966) reported clinicoanatomic studies of a 64-year-old man with nonarteriosclerotic, idiopathic intracerebral calcification of the blood vessels. The disorder was diagnosed radiologically in 3 generations of the family. Clinical features included fits, pyramidal symptoms, cerebellar dysarthria, and psychiatric changes. Calcification involved the media and adventitia of brain vessels of all sizes, and calcium concretions lay free in the tissues. Male-to-male transmission was not proven.
Moskowitz et al. (1971) reported a family in which 5 members spanning 2 generations had calcification of the basal ganglia. The proband was a 47-year-old man who presented with a 10-year history of progressive choreoathetosis, increasing clumsiness, progressive urinary incontinence, and difficulty with concentration and recent memory. Physical examination showed truncal and gait cerebellar ataxia, as well as dysarthria. Serum calcium and phosphorus were normal. Radiographic analysis showed symmetric calcifications of the basal ganglia and deep cerebellar nuclei. CSF was normal. A brother was similarly affected, but also had parkinsonism with bradykinesia, rigidity, and mental depression. Two asymptomatic daughters of the proband, aged 13 and 15 years, had calcification of the basal ganglia. Excretion of 3-prime, 5-prime-AMP, both basal and in response to PTH, was higher in the patients compared to controls. The findings clearly distinguished the disorder in this family from disorders of parathyroid hormone.
In 5 of 9 sibs born of related parents, Nyland and Skre (1977) found progressive encephalopathy with onset in middle life and massive calcification of the basal ganglia, dentate nuclei and cerebral sulci of the brain shown radiographically. Clinical features included mental deterioration, extrapyramidal motor deficits, cerebellar ataxia, and tremor. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH were normal. Exogenous PTH induced a subnormal phosphate diuresis despite normal urinary excretion of cyclic AMP, and the authors suggested that the disorder was an unusual form of pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this family, the disorder was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.
Francis (1979) described a family in which schizophreniform psychosis was associated with basal ganglia consistent with either autosomal or X-linked dominant inheritance. There were no skeletal or biochemical signs of pseudohypoparathyroidism. Calcification first became evident radiographically at puberty. Developmental delay occurred in 2 brothers whose mother was affected. One person had progressive parkinsonism, and 4 had extrapyramidal symptoms attributed to phenothiazine medication, suggesting increased sensitivity to these medications. Francis (1979) noted that a schizophrenia-like psychosis may be seen in other disorders of the basal ganglia, including Wilson disease (277900) and Huntington disease (143100).
Puvanendran and Wong (1980) reported 2 Japanese sisters who had idiopathic basal ganglia calcifications associated with severe hypertension in their teens. Follow-up of 14 years showed no neurologic deficits.
Smits et al. (1983) described 3 sibs, 2 men and a woman, with symmetric calcification in the striopallidodentate system. The eldest sib had onset in her late thirties of progressive speech and motor impairment. Neurologic examination at age 41 years showed choreic movements of the head, tongue, and limbs, as well as ataxic gait, dysarthria, and dysmetria. She also demonstrated mental deterioration. Serum calcium and phosphorus and response to PTH administration were all normal. CT scan showed dense symmetric calcifications in the striatum, globus pallidus, dentate nucleus, pons, and in the radiation of the corpus callosum. The patient's 2 younger brothers, aged 32 and 36 years, had normal neurologic exams, but showed calcifications on CT imaging. Smits et al. (1983) suggested autosomal recessive inheritance, and considered this to be the ninth reported family with autosomal recessive SPD calcinosis; others included those reported by Matthews (1957), Bruyn et al. (1964), and Nyland and Skre (1977).
Harati et al. (1984) reported a family in which 2 brothers were affected with a progressive adult-onset disorder characterized by gait impairment, parkinsonism, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone were all normal. Brain imaging in both brothers showed dense basal ganglia calcifications extending into the periventricular white matter and involvement of the dentate nucleus. A brother and mother reportedly had a similar clinical phenotype, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance.
Ellie et al. (1989) reported father and son with striopallidodentate calcifications in whom calcium and phosphorus metabolism was normal. The father showed a progressive disorder characterized predominantly by mental deterioration, cerebellar dysarthria, and clumsiness of fine movement. He later developed partial motor seizures. Skull radiograph showed dense, symmetric calcifications in the basal ganglia and dentate nuclei. One asymptomatic son had calcifications limited to the pallidum. In a review of the literature, Ellie et al. (1989) concluded that clinical symptoms begin between ages 30 and 50 years and are relentlessly progressive. Calcifications tend to begin within the basal ganglia, later affecting the cerebellum and deep white matter.
Manyam et al. (1992) reported a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis. Calcium deposits occurred before the onset of symptoms in the third decade of life. The proband showed progressive neurologic deterioration in the fifth decade. Manyam et al. (1992) found that CT scan was superior to MRI in the diagnosis. PET scan did not reveal any disturbance in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. Martinelli et al. (1993) found that 3 symptomatic members of an affected family had reduced 25-OH-vitamin D3 with normal levels of 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3, suggesting an inborn error of vitamin D metabolism. Clinical features included late onset of parkinsonism, dysarthria, and depression.
Flint and Goldstein (1992) reported a mother and son with IBGC. The son developed paranoid schizophrenia and intellectual deterioration, while the mother had no psychiatric illness. After a review of the literature, the authors concluded that psychosis may be only coincidentally associated with familial IBGC. Callender (1995) reported intracranial calcifications in a mother and 2 sons who presented in middle age with schizophrenia.
Kobari et al. (1997) reported a Japanese family in which 5 members were affected with autosomal dominant idiopathic brain calcifications. The proband was a 48-year-old man who presented with memory impairment, gait disturbances, and parkinsonism beginning in his early thirties. Serum calcium and phosphorus were normal, CSF studies were normal. Upon PTH administration, he had a normal urinary cAMP response, but a slightly reduced phosphaturic response. Brain CT showed dense calcifications in the basal ganglia bilaterally, as well as in the thalamus, hippocampus, subcortical white matter, and cerebral cortex. The patient's parents and 2 sons, aged 21 and 15 years, had calcification of the lentiform nuclei without neurologic defects. In a review of the literature, Kobari et al. (1997) noted that clinical symptoms appeared between 30 and 50 years of age and included mental decline, parkinsonism, choreoathetosis, and cerebellar ataxia. Less common features included pyramidal signs, psychiatric symptoms, and urinary incontinence. Calcifications tended to be detected first in the basal ganglia, and later in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, thalamus, subcortical white matter, and cerebral cortex. Neurologic signs correlated with increased calcium load.
Manyam et al. (2001) reported 38 patients: 30 from 5 families with autosomal dominant inheritance and 8 sporadic cases. The authors also reviewed 20 publications comprising 61 patients. Inclusion criteria included radiographic evidence of calcifications, normal childhood growth and development, and absence of parathyroid disorders. In all, 67 patients were symptomatic and 32 were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation. The most common disease manifestation was movement disorders (55%), of which parkinsonism was the most common (57%), followed by chorea (19%), tremor (8%), dystonia (8%), athetosis (5%), and orofacial dyskinesia (3%). Other common features included cognitive defects (39% of patients), speech disorders (36%), cerebellar signs (36%), psychiatric manifestations (31%), pyramidal signs (22%), and sensory symptoms (16%). Symptomatic patients had a significantly greater amount of calcification compared to asymptomatic patients. Calcification was seen in the basal ganglia, thalamus, dentate nucleus, and centrum semiovale.
Lester et al. (2006) provided a case report of a 50-year-old man with Fahr disease. He presented with dysarthria and later developed wide-based gait, inability to write, dysphagia, emotional lability, supranuclear gaze palsies, dysmetria, and focal dystonia. He also had pyramidal and cerebellar signs. Brain imaging showed diffuse intracranial calcifications in multiple brain regions, which the authors noted was unusual for Fahr disease.
Weisman et al. (2007) reported a man with Fahr disease who died 10 years after symptom onset. At age 61 years, he developed slowly progressive memory difficulties, which progressed to fine motor dysfunction and changes in personality consistent with frontotemporal dementia (see 600274). CT scan showed diffuse calcification. The patient's condition deteriorated, with passivity, dysarthria, and upper and lower motor neuron signs. Postmortem analysis showed extensive capillary and parenchymal microcalcifications throughout the white matter and the cortical and subcortical gray matter.
Families With Identified SLC20A2 Mutations
Geschwind et al. (1999) reported a multigenerational family with dominantly inherited IBGC. A 39-year-old woman with a history of symptomatic basal ganglia calcification presented her 2 daughters for neurologic evaluation of a movement disorder. One demonstrated dystonia and chorea, whereas the other manifested a coarse tremor and motor delay. The mother had initially presented with writing tremor at age 18 years, which progressed to focal dystonia and mild generalized chorea by her mid-twenties. The age at onset appeared to be decreasing by an average of more than 20 years with each transmission, suggesting genetic anticipation.
Manyam et al. (2001) reported 3 patients from a large family with autosomal dominant bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis. The proband was found to have bilateral calcium deposits in the basal ganglia at age 42 when a CT was taken after a fall. Three years later, he developed progressive and severe parkinsonism that was responsive to L-DOPA treatment. However, the movement disorder was progressive, he developed neuropsychiatric problems, and he died of cardiac disease. Neuropathologic examination showed significant calcium deposition in multiple brain regions, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, pons, and white matter. Sections of the substantia nigra showed neuronal loss, gliosis, Lewy bodies, and free neuromelanin within neurons. Eighteen of 27 family members available for study showed brain calcifications on imaging, although most were asymptomatic. Only 2 other family members had calcifications associated with mild or moderate parkinsonism. Neuropathologic studies of 1 of the relatives showed no Lewy bodies. Manyam et al. (2001) concluded that the family had autosomal dominant cerebral calcinosis, but that the parkinsonism in the proband may have been coincidental.
Brodaty et al. (2002) studied a multigenerational family ascertained through 2 sisters in their seventies with radiologic evidence of basal ganglia calcification, dementia, bipolar affective disorder, and parkinsonism. Of the 10 family members with radiologic intracranial calcification, none except the 2 index cases had dementia, bipolar affective disorder, or parkinsonism. Brodaty et al. (2002) suggested that this family had a form of IBGC in which calcification is inherited independently of neurologic, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms.
Volpato et al. (2008) reported a large multigenerational Italian family from South Tyrol with IBGC. Twenty individuals over the age of 40 had positive CT scans revealing intracranial calcifications, with 14 having bilateral moderate to severe calcification of the basal ganglia, dentate nucleus, and subcortical white matter. Six had calcifications only in the pineal gland and/or choroid plexus. The calcification was age-dependent. Four individuals had hyperreflexia, 2 of whom also had gait and upper limb ataxia, slurred speech, and intellectual impairment. Four patients had short stature, 2 had short neck, and 1 had frontal hyperostosis and upper limb hypotrophy. In this family, the radiologic penetrance was much higher than the clinical penetrance, which was low.
Dai et al. (2010) reported a large 5-generation nonconsanguineous Chinese family in which 9 individuals had idiopathic basal ganglia calcification. The proband was a 36-year-old man with headache and discomfort in the head after drinking alcohol. Brain imaging showed symmetric calcium deposition in the caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, globus pallidus, inferior part of thalamus, and occipital lobes. Known disorders of parathyroid hormone, calcium regulation, phosphorus metabolism, ceruloplasmin, and other infectious etiologies were excluded. Brain imaging of other family members revealed 8 additional patients with basal ganglia calcifications. However, only 4 had clinical symptoms of headache, 1 also with depression; 5 were asymptomatic. All were adults, except for 1 asymptomatic 9-year-old boy, who had calcifications only in the globus pallidus.
Wang et al. (2012) reported a 4-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant IBGC. Five patients were clinically asymptomatic and 1 had parkinsonism and cerebral infarction at age 73 years. However, the index case was a 12-year-old girl with epilepsy starting at age 1 year, followed by developmental delay and mental retardation after about age 4. Serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone were normal. Brain MRI showed marked symmetric calcium deposition in the basal ganglia, inferior part of the thalamus, cerebellum, frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, and subcortex. Her younger sister had a similarly severe phenotype, with mental retardation, epilepsy, dysarthria, and ataxia associated with marked calcium deposition throughout the brain. The images of these 2 patients with a severe clinical phenotype showed significantly more calcium deposition compared to the asymptomatic patients, who had calcium deposition primarily limited to the basal ganglia and inferior part of the thalamus.



PIK3R1
**?Agammaglobulinemia 7, autosomal recessive, 615214 (3), AR**
De la Morena et al. (1995) reported a 6-month-old Hispanic girl of Chinese and Peruvian Indian ancestry who presented at age 3.5 months with interstitial pneumonia and gastroenteritis. Laboratory studies showed agammaglobulinemia, neutropenia, and lack of mature B cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Lymph nodes showed lack of B cells, plasma cells, and germinal center formation. T cells and T-cell function were normal. Presence of CD10+ cells but absence of CD19+ cells and a 10-fold decrease of mature V-D-J-C-mu transcripts suggested a blockage at an earlier stage of B-cell development than that observed in the X-linked form of agammaglobulinemia (300755); genetic analysis excluded a defect in the BTK gene (300300).
Conley et al. (2012) provided follow-up of the patient reported by de la Morena et al. (1995), who was 19 years old and showed a severe defect in very early B-cell development. As a teenager, she developed erythema nodosum, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and recurrent Campylobacter bacteremia and inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting disordered cytokine production. The family history was positive for 2 older brothers and 2 maternal uncles who died of acute infections between 9 and 18 months of age.
**Immunodeficiency 36, 616005 (3), AD**
IMD36 is a primary immunodeficiency with a highly heterogeneous clinical phenotype, characterized primarily by recurrent respiratory tract infections, lymphoproliferation, and antibody deficiency. Other features include growth retardation, mild neurodevelopmental delay, and autoimmunity. The major complication is development of B-cell lymphoma (Elkaim et al., 2016).
Deau et al. (2014) reported 4 patients from 3 unrelated families with a primary immunodeficiency. A mother and son were affected in 1 of the families. Two patients presented with recurrent respiratory infections at age 6 months, a third at age 2 years, and the fourth at age 13 years. All had bacterial infections, but only 1 patient had chronic viremia with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). None had features of allergy, autoimmunity, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy. Lymphocyte counts were in the normal range, but there were decreased numbers of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Two patients had a deficiency of memory B cells. One patient had almost complete absence of switched memory B cells, whereas the other 3 patients had increased transitional B cells. All had impaired B-cell function with hypogammaglobulinemia associated with increased IgM. T-cell blasts displayed enhanced activation-induced cell death, and B cells showed weak proliferation in response to activation via the B-cell receptor and TLR9 (605474). Three patients were on Ig replacement therapy.
Lucas et al. (2014) studied 4 patients from 3 unrelated families with immunodeficiency, including a 32-year-old Turkish woman (family A), a Caucasian American 43-year-old mother and her 17-year-old son (family B), and a 5-year-old Chinese boy (family C). The patients showed a similar phenotype involving recurrent sinopulmonary infections, poor production of class-switched antibodies, and lymphoproliferation, with splenomegaly present in 3 of the 4 patients. All had low serum IgG and IgA levels; however, IgM was elevated in the Turkish woman, normal in the Caucasian American boy, and low in the Chinese boy. Additional features included the development of arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease in adulthood in the Turkish woman, and severe juvenile arthritis in the Chinese boy. All required intravenous immunoglobulin supplementation and had a low CD4/CD8 ratio due to expansion of CD8 T cells. The authors noted that the clinical features of immunodeficiency, lymphoproliferation, poor immunoglobulin responses, and expansion of CD8 T cells with susceptibility to inflammatory disease were consistent with immunodeficiency-14 (IMD14; 615513).
Lougaris et al. (2015) reported 4 unrelated children from Albania, Italy, and Sweden, with immunodeficiency and mutations in the PIK3R1 gene. All had hypogammaglobulinemia with elevated serum IgM levels, and all exhibited lymphoproliferation, with 2 developing severe tonsillar hypertrophy and 1 having splenomegaly; 3 of the 4 patients also showed poor growth. In addition, 2 exhibited an abnormal expansion of immature B cells with a concomitant reduction of mature B cells, which the authors stated was a pattern not previously reported in PIK3R1-mutated patients.
Elkaim et al. (2016) retrospectively analyzed 36 patients with PIK3R1-associated immunodeficiency, including the 8 patients previously reported by Deau et al. (2014) and Lucas et al. (2014). The most common features were recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (100%), pneumonitis (71%), and chronic lymphoproliferation (89%), including adenopathy (75%), splenomegaly (43%), and upper respiratory tract lymphoid hyperplasia (48%). Growth retardation was frequently observed (45%). Other complications were mild neurodevelopmental delay (31%), malignant diseases (28%) consisting mostly of B-cell lymphomas, autoimmunity (17%), bronchiectasis (18%), and chronic diarrhea (24%). The predominant immunologic features included decreased serum IgA and IgG levels (87%), increased IgM levels (58%), B-cell lymphopenia (88%) associated with an increased frequency of transitional B cells (93%), and decreased numbers of naive CD4 and naive CD8 cells but increased numbers of CD8 effector/memory T cells. The majority of patients (89%) received immunoglobulin replacement. Five patients died, including 4 from lymphoma. Elkaim et al. (2016) designated the immunodeficiency disorder 'activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome-2' (APDS2) or PASLI-R1; see IMD14, 615513.
**SHORT syndrome, 269880 (3), AD**
'Short,' the mnemonic designation for this syndrome, is an acronym: S = stature; H = hyperextensibility of joints or hernia (inguinal) or both; O = ocular depression; R = Rieger anomaly; T = teething delay. The name was given by Gorlin (1975), who described the syndrome in 2 brothers.
Dyment et al. (2013) noted that the features listed in the acronym for SHORT syndrome do not capture the full range of the clinical phenotype, which can include a recognizable facial gestalt consisting of triangular facies, lack of facial fat, and hypoplastic nasal alae with overhanging columella, as well as near-universal partial lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, nephrocalcinosis, and hearing deficits. Notably, both developmental milestones and cognition are normal for individuals with SHORT syndrome.
Sensenbrenner et al. (1975) described a 6-year-old girl with Rieger anomaly, short stature, and partial lipodystrophy of the face and upper limbs. She also had delayed dental eruption, delayed bone age, and hyperextensibility of the joints. Gorlin (1975) reported the same condition in 2 brothers, aged 11 and 4 years. Gorlin (1975) suggested autosomal recessive inheritance because of possible consanguinity in 1 set of parents.
Aarskog et al. (1983) described a family from the Lofoten Islands of Norway in which 4 persons in 3 generations had nonprogressive lipodystrophy present from infancy affecting primarily the face and buttocks. Affected persons also had the Rieger anomaly, midface hypoplasia, retarded bone age, and hypotrichosis. Of 2 sisters, 1 had glucose intolerance at age 55 years, and the other had insulinopenic diabetes mellitus at age 39 years. Aarskog et al. (1983) suggested that the disorder in their family was distinct from SHORT syndrome because of the absence of joint hypermobility and less extensive lipodystrophy in their patients.
Toriello et al. (1985) reported a patient with SHORT syndrome characterized by lipoatrophy, delayed speech development, clinodactyly, and short stature. The boy also had deafness, which the authors noted had not previously been reported in the SHORT syndrome. Stratton et al. (1989) reported a brother and sister with short stature, delayed bone age, developmental delay, congenital hip dislocation, and iridocorneal abnormalities with onset of glaucoma at or soon after birth. Many of the features resembled those of the SHORT syndrome, but triangular face and lipoatrophy were not present.
Schwingshandl et al. (1993) described a girl with most of the typical features of SHORT syndrome who, at age 14 years, developed nonketotic hyperglycemia. At the age of 16.5 years, diabetes mellitus with severe insulin resistance was diagnosed. From an early age, the patient had had partial lipodystrophy, as well as megalocornea and a peculiar progeria-like face. At age 6 years, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was detected.
Verge et al. (1994) also described insulin-resistant diabetes in SHORT syndrome. They suggested that defective function of insulin receptors in adipose tissue may explain the paucity of fat storage in this disorder.
Bankier et al. (1995) described the association of triangular face, deep-set eyes, micrognathia, small facial bones, and narrow body build in 3 members of an English family and in an unrelated Australian girl. Absence of iridal stroma was found in the Australian girl and in the English mother; the son of the English woman also had sensorineural deafness. Bankier et al. (1995) noted that the symptom complex was similar to the SHORT syndrome, although all 4 patients had low-normal height and did not manifest joint hyperextensibility. Reardon and Temple (2008) reported that 1 of the female patients reported by Bankier et al. (1995) developed nephrocalcinosis as an adult. The affected son of this patient, who was diagnosed with SHORT syndrome in the neonatal period, had nephrocalcinosis and increased serum and urinary calcium at 2 months of age.
Sorge et al. (1996) described a 9-year-old Italian boy with short stature, partial lipodystrophy, minor facial anomalies, mild hyperextensibility of joints, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly, and delay in speech development and dental eruption. Because the father and sister showed a striking similarity to the propositus, Sorge et al. (1996) suggested an autosomal dominant gene with variable expression in this family. The sister had bilateral and symmetrical lens opacities, a feature that had not been reported previously in affected subjects or their relatives. Sorge et al. (1996) suggested that the disorder reported by Aarskog et al. (1983) was the same disorder.
Brodsky et al. (1996) added congenital glaucoma as a feature of the SHORT syndrome. Their patient was a 9-year-old boy who had enlarged cloudy corneas, Rieger anomaly, and elevated intraocular pressure at birth. He also had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, and mild developmental delay. The face had a triangular configuration with prominent forehead, deeply set eyes, thin nasal alae, and a proportionately small middle and lower face. The face and chest showed diminished subcutaneous fat, and the hands had thin, dry, wrinkled skin, producing a progeroid appearance. A paternal uncle reportedly had a similar appearance.
Koenig et al. (2003) described a mother and son with short stature, progeroid facies, Rieger anomaly, teething delay, mild developmental retardation, particularly speech delay, and a slight build with lack of subcutaneous fat. Resistance to insulin was suggested by an oral glucose tolerance test in the mother, whereas the test was normal in the son at the age of 2 years. After reviewing the reported cases of SHORT syndrome, Koenig et al. (2003) concluded that 5 familial cases in different generations, equally affected male and female patients, and male-to-male transmission support autosomal dominant inheritance, possibly with germline mosaicism in the cases of affected sibs and unaffected parents.
Reardon and Temple (2008) reported 3 patients, including a mother and son previously reported by Bankier et al. (1995), with a clinical diagnosis of SHORT syndrome who all developed nephrocalcinosis. Two of the patients had nephrocalcinosis in infancy and also showed increased serum and urinary calcium. Reardon and Temple (2008) postulated that disordered calcium metabolism may be a previously unreported feature of SHORT syndrome.
Reis et al. (2011) studied a 6-year-old Caucasian girl with a diagnosis of SHORT syndrome, whose ocular features included Rieger anomaly, congenital glaucoma, microcornea, and nystagmus. She had short stature, poor weight gain, and macrocephaly, as well as hyperextensible joints, delayed eruption of teeth, decreased subcutaneous fat in the upper trunk and head, and dysmorphic facial features including prominent forehead, sunken eyes, small chin, and hypoplastic nares. Her hearing was normal, hands and feet were small with normal structure, and umbilicus was described as 'a bit pouchy' with mildly increased skin. Brain MRI showed normal structures.
Avila et al. (2016) reviewed the clinical features of 32 individuals, including 8 newly ascertained patients, with genetically confirmed SHORT syndrome. The major features described in the SHORT acronym were not universally seen, and only half (52%) had 4 or more of the classic features. The most common features included intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction, lipoatrophy, and a characteristic facial gestalt characterized by a progeroid appearance with prominent forehead, triangular face, deep-set eyes, hypoplastic alae nasi, midface hypoplasia, small chin, low-set ears, and downturned mouth. Hyperextensible joints or inguinal hernia was found in only 10 of 29 cases, and Rieger anomaly was only found in 13 of 30 cases, although some patients had other anterior chamber defects. Insulin resistance was found in 13 of 17 patients, and diabetes was found in 9 of 14. Three patients had cardiac anomalies and 5 had sensorineural deafness. Avila et al. (2016) concluded that cardinal features of the disorder warranting monitoring include lipoatrophy and insulin resistance, and that minor features of SHORT syndrome should include teething delay, thin wrinkled skin, speech delay, sensorineural deafness, hyperextensibility of joints, and inguinal hernia.



PCNT
**Nephrotic syndrome, type 17, 618176 (3), AR**
NPHS17, a disease of the renal glomerular filter, is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. It does not respond to drug treatment and inevitably progresses to end-stage renal disease, thus requiring dialysis or renal transplantation for survival. Renal histology shows focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Braun et al., 2018).
For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of nephrotic syndrome, see NPHS1 (256300).
Braun et al. (2018) reported 4 patients from 3 unrelated families who presented between 4 and 11 years of age with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and microscopic hematuria. Renal biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Three patients progressed to end-stage renal disease between 7 and 12 years of age. Two unrelated patients had short stature, and 2 sibs in 1 family had intellectual disability.
**Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type II, 210720 (3), AR**
Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, severe proportionate short stature, and microcephaly. It is distinct from Seckel syndrome (see 210600) by more severe growth retardation, radiologic abnormalities, and absent or mild mental retardation (summary by Willems et al., 2010).
In 3 unrelated children, Majewski et al. (1982) described a form of intrauterine and postnatal dwarfism with microcephaly and facial features resembling those of Seckel syndrome (see 210600) but with anomalies of bones: disproportionate shortness of forearms and legs in the first years of life, brachymesophalangy, brachymetacarpy I, V-shaped flare of at least the distal femoral metaphyses, triangular shape of the distal femoral epiphyses, high and narrow pelvis, proximal femoral epiphysiolysis, and coxa vara. They pointed to seemingly identical cases reported by Brizard et al. (1973) and Anoussakis et al. (1974). All 5 cases were sporadic. Majewski (1982) suggested that this might be the same as the Taybi-Linder syndrome (MOPD1; 210710). Willems et al. (1987) reported what they presumed to be the sixth case in a child of consanguineous parents. The genetics may be clarified by the findings of Verloes et al. (1987) who observed male and female affected sibs, the offspring of first-cousin parents. One of the affected sibs reported by Verloes et al. (1987) was a twin. Inasmuch as the other twin was unaffected, a photograph of the twins demonstrated the abnormality dramatically.
Sugio et al. (1993) reported a case. The mother was short, with a small head and disproportionately short forearms and legs, for which reason Sugio et al. (1993) suggested dominant inheritance. It would seem equally likely that the mother was a manifesting heterozygote.
Al Gazali et al. (1995) reported a typical case of the syndrome in a girl of Baluch origin. Complex consanguinity in this family confirmed autosomal recessive inheritance of the disorder.
This disorder was mentioned as a possibility in the case of 2 African American brothers who had microcephaly, short stature, and generalized microdontia (Lin et al., 1995). The face was not typical of Seckel syndrome. Radiographic features of the skeleton were mild, yet growth was severely delayed.
Masuno et al. (1995) described a 22-month-old Japanese girl with microcephaly, prominent nose, pre- and postnatal dwarfism, increased intraocular pressure, mesomelic shortening of the legs, brachydactyly, multiple pseudoepiphyses in the bases of the metacarpals, coxa valga, wide pelvis with iliac flaring, disharmonious maturation of the epiphyses, and patent cranial sutures. The girl resembled children with osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism II, although she did not have mesomelic shortening of the forearms, metaphyseal flaring, or typical narrow pelvis. Masuno et al. (1995) could not exclude the possibility that this case represented a new variant of osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism.
Halder et al. (1998) described a 7-year-old boy with osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II with normal intellect but delayed myelination on brain MRI.
Majewski and Goecke (1998) reported 3 new cases of MOPD II and reviewed 14 published cases. All children had marked intrauterine and postnatal growth failure, disproportionate microcephaly, and mental retardation. They were disproportionately short statured due to short limbs. Characteristic skeletal anomalies included small iliac wings with flat acetabular angles, coxa vara, V-shaped distal femoral metaphyses, and triangular distal femoral epiphyses, as well as metacarpal pseudoepiphyses, short first metacarpals, and brachymesophalangy V. One of their cases developed bilateral epiphysiolysis of the femoral heads at age 3. Majewski and Goecke (1998) commented that the cases of Sugio et al. (1993) probably represent another type of intrauterine growth retardation, as neither the mother nor the child was as small as in MOPD II and the mother's intellect was normal.
Fukuzawa et al. (2002) reported the autopsy findings in a Japanese girl with typical clinical and radiologic features of MOPD II. The manifestations included severe intrauterine and postnatal growth failure, microcephaly, a distinctive facial appearance, micromelia, brachytelephalangy, coxa vera, and V-shaped metaphyses of the distal femurs. Other than small cerebral hemispheres, no neuropathologic abnormalities were found. Chondroosseous histology showed thinning of the growth plate, ballooned chondrocytes, reduced cellularity, lack of zonal and columnar formations, and poor formation of primary trabeculae. These findings suggested that impairment of chondrocytic formation and differentiation is the major pathogenesis of MOPD II.
Fukuzawa et al. (2002) compared the pathology of Seckel syndrome with that of MOPD types I (210710), II, and III (210730).
Hall et al. (2004) reviewed the clinical features of MOPD II on the basis of 58 affected individuals (27 from the literature and 31 previously unreported cases). The remarkable features of MOPD II were found to be severe intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and severe postnatal growth retardation; relatively proportionate head size at birth which progresses to true and disproportionate microcephaly; progressive disproportion of the short stature secondary to shortening of the distal and middle segments of the limbs; a progressive bony dysplasia with metaphyseal changes in the limbs; epiphyseal delay; progressive loose-jointedness with occasional dislocation or subluxation of the knees, radial heads, and hips; unusual facial features including a prominent nose, eyes that appear prominent in infancy and early childhood, ears that are proportionate, mildly dysplastic, and usually missing the lobule; a high squeaky voice; abnormally small, and often dysplastic or missing, dentition; a pleasant, outgoing, sociable personality; and autosomal recessive inheritance. Hyperopia, scoliosis, unusual pigmentation, and truncal obesity often develop with time. Some individuals seem to have increased susceptibility to infections. There was variability between affected individuals even within the same family. Useful clinical photographs were provided.
Piane et al. (2009) reported a 3-year-old Italian boy who had prenatal onset of proportionate dwarfism, postnatal severe microcephaly, high forehead with receding hairline, sparse scalp hair, beaked nose, mild retrognathia, and hypotonia, who was diagnosed at birth with Seckel syndrome. At age 3 years, he developed paresis of the right arm due to stenosis of the median cerebral artery. X-ray examination showed high iliac wings, narrow ischia and pubis, overtubulated long bones, delta-shaped distal femoral metaphyses with marked widening, brachytelemesophalangia, and delayed bone age. Given the proportionate head size at birth, subsequent growth retardation, cerebrovascular abnormalities, and evidence for skeletal dysplasia, the diagnosis was changed from Seckel to MOPD II.
Clinical Variability
In a Thai brother and sister, Kantaputra (2002) described a syndrome of proportionate primordial short stature, severe microdontia with opalescent teeth and rootless molars, severely hypoplastic alveolar bone, large sella turcica, and slender and straight clavicles with hypoplastic scapulae. Facial features included large nose with prominent nasal bridge and small pinnae. There were areas of hypo- and hyperpigmentation that did not follow Blaschko lines, and the scalp hair was dry and thin. Intelligence and hearing were normal. Both sibs had narrow chests and pelvises, decreased elbow extension, distal symphalangism of toes, and brachymesophalangy of fingers. Radiographic features of the hands and wrists included ivory and cone-shaped epiphyses that usually disappeared with age and angular scaphoid and trapezium bones.
Kantaputra et al. (2004) reported 2 Thai children, male and female third cousins, with the same syndrome as the brother and sister reported by Kantaputra (2002). Features of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism included intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), microcephaly, prominent nose and nasal bridge, small pinnae, short stature, cone-shaped and ivory epiphyses, delayed bone age, slender long bones, and abnormal pelvis. Additional features pointing to a distinct syndrome, which the authors designated 'MOPD with tooth abnormalities,' consisted of severe microdontia, malformed teeth, single-rooted or rootless teeth, severely hypoplastic alveolar bone, cafe-au-lait spots, acanthosis nigricans, and areas of hypo- and hyperpigmented skin.
Hall (2005) argued that the patients reported by Kantaputra (2002) and Kantaputra et al. (2004) as having a distinct entity, MOPD with tooth anomalies, in fact had classic MOPD II. Kantaputra and Tanpaiboon (2005) responded that although the disorders may be allelic, the microdontia in those patients 'was severe beyond the spectrum of MOPD type II.'
Kantaputra et al. (2011) provided follow-up on the 2 unrelated Thai families with MOPD and tooth anomalies, previously reported by Kantaputra (2002) and Kantaputra et al. (2004). The brother and sister reported in 2002, now 26 and 24 years old, respectively, were healthy except for MOPD II-related features. The brother had lost all of his permanent teeth, whereas the sister had 5 remaining permanent teeth with 1 unerupted right mandibular premolar, and in both sibs the alveolar bone was severely hypoplastic. Reevaluation at ages 12 and 10 years, respectively, of the cousins reported in 2004 showed that primary teeth were of normal size but permanent teeth were extremely small, measuring 2 mm to 2.5 mm mesiodistally. The authors commented that the teeth were 'probably the smallest ever reported.' All first permanent molars, however, were of normal size but rootless. The male cousin died of unknown cause at 11 years of age; the girl was otherwise healthy. All 4 patients had skin that was hypo- and hyperpigmented, dry, and appeared darker as they aged; multiple creases were present on the palms and soles. After molecular analysis revealed mutations in the PCNT gene in affected individuals from both families (see MOLECULAR GENETICS), Kantaputra et al. (2011) concluded that the severe microdontia and alveolar bone hypoplasia in these patients, which seemed to indicate a distinct syndrome, instead represented the variability of the MOPD II phenotype.



SNRPN
**Prader-Willi syndrome, 176270 (3), AD**
Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, muscular hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and small hands and feet. It can be considered to be an autosomal dominant disorder and is caused by deletion or disruption of a gene or several genes on the proximal long arm of the paternal chromosome 15 or maternal uniparental disomy 15, because the gene(s) on the maternal chromosome(s) 15 are virtually inactive through imprinting. Horsthemke and Wagstaff (2008) provided a detailed review of the mechanisms of imprinting of the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (105830) region.
See also the chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (608636), which shows overlapping clinical features.
The original paper by Prader et al. (1956) described the full clinical picture.
Prenatal
Mothers with prior experience of normal pregnancies almost without exception report distinctly delayed onset and reduced fetal activity during the pregnancies involving Prader-Willi children. Obstetricians often fail to detect diminished fetal activity with ultrasound investigation. When reduced fetal activity is observed, prenatal cytogenetic examination produces normal results because cytogeneticists were not instructed to look for the characteristic chromosomal changes of PWS (Schinzel, 1986). Alert clinicians should refer CVS material from pregnancies with fetuses that demonstrate poor activity for molecular diagnosis of the syndrome (see below). Other candidates for prenatal diagnosis of PWS are fetuses of pregnancies in which trisomy 15 or mosaic trisomy 15 was determined from CVS, and in which subsequent amniocyte or fetal blood examinations disclosed a normal diploid karyotype. Theoretically, one-third of trisomy 15 fetuses initially with 2 maternal chromosomes 15 and 1 paternal chromosome 15 should give rise to Prader-Willi syndrome patients exhibiting maternal uniparental disomy (Cassidy et al., 1992; Purvis-Smith et al., 1992; Hall, 1992).
Perinatal
Neonates are profoundly hypotonic, which often causes asphyxia. In addition, there is mild prenatal growth retardation with a mean birth weight of about 6 lbs (2.8 kg) at term, hyporeflexia, poor feeding due to diminished swallowing and sucking reflexes, which in many cases necessitates gavage feeding for about 3 to 4 months. Cryptorchidism occurs with hypoplastic penis and scrotum in boys and hypoplastic labiae in girls (Stephenson, 1980). Chitayat et al. (1989) commented on the normal size of hands and feet at birth and in the first year of life.
Miller et al. (1999) described 6 newborns evaluated for hypotonia who were later diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome. These newborns lacked the classic neonatal features of the syndrome (peculiar cry, characteristic craniofacial features, and clinical evidence of hypogonadism). The authors suggested that specific genetic testing for PWS be considered for all neonates with undiagnosed central hypotonia even in the absence of the other major features of the syndrome.
Oiglane-Shlik et al. (2006) studied 5 newborns with hypotonia, poor arousal, weak or absent cry, and no interest in food, in whom PWS was confirmed by the abnormal methylation test. All had a distinctive facial appearance, with high prominent forehead, narrow bifrontal diameter, downturned corners of the mouth, micrognathia, and dysplastic ears. Three neonates had a high-arched palate, and 4 had arachnodactyly. In the first few days of life, 4 of the 5 patients demonstrated a peculiar position of the hands, with the thumb constantly adducted over the index and middle finger. All 5 patients had transient bradycardia, thermolability, and acrocyanosis; and 3 also showed marked skin mottling, as previously reported by Chitayat et al. (1989).
Infancy and Childhood
Feeding difficulties generally improve by the age of 6 months. From 12 to 18 months onward, uncontrollable hyperphagia causes major somatic as well as psychologic problems. Diminished growth is observed in the majority of infants (Butler and Meaney, 1987). Small hands with delicate and tapering fingers and small feet (acromicria) are seen in most infants and adolescents; hand and foot sizes correlate well with length, but not with age, and foot size tends to be lower than hand size. However, patients of normal height tend to have normally sized hands (Hudgins and Cassidy, 1991). The face is characterized by a narrow bifrontal diameter, almond-shaped eyes (often in mild upslanted position), strabismus, full cheeks, and diminished mimic activity due to muscular hypotonia. Plethoric obesity becomes the most striking feature. From the age of about 6 years onward, many children present scars from scratching due to itching, and later, almost all show abdominal striae.
Depigmentation relative to the familial background is a feature in about three-quarters of the patients. Butler (1989), Hittner et al. (1982), and several authors remarked that this sign is confined to cases with deletions and absent in those with maternal disomy 15. Phelan et al. (1988) presented a black female child with oculocutaneous albinism, PWS, and an interstitial deletion of 15q11.2. Patients with classic albinism (203100) have misrouting of optic fibers, with fibers from 20 degrees or more of the temporal retina crossing at the chiasm instead of projecting to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Misrouting can result in strabismus and nystagmus. Because patients with PWS have hypopigmentation and strabismus, Creel et al. (1986) studied 6 patients, selected for a history of strabismus, with pattern-onset visual evoked potentials on binocular and monocular stimulation. Of the 4 with hypopigmentation, 3 had abnormal evoked potentials indistinguishable from those recorded in albinos. The 2 with normal pigmentation had normal responses. Wiesner et al. (1987) found that 14 of 29 patients with PWS had ocular hypopigmentation. There was possible correlation between hypopigmentation and a deletion of 15q.
MacMillan et al. (1972) described 2 unrelated girls with the features of PWS who additionally showed precocious puberty. They suggested that this is a variant and that a hypothalamic disturbance is responsible for this disorder. Hall and Smith (1972) pointed out narrow bifrontal cranial diameter as a feature. Hall (1985) pointed to a possibly increased risk of leukemia in PWS.
A frequent feature generally overlooked is thick saliva at the edges of the mouth. Patients tend to be relatively insensitive to pain (including that caused by obtaining blood samples)(Prader, 1991).
Eiholzer et al. (1999) presented data on body composition and leptin (164160) levels of 13 young, still underweight children and 10 older overweight children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Both groups showed elevated skinfold standard deviation scores for body mass index and elevated body mass index-adjusted leptin levels, suggesting relatively increased body fat even in underweight children. Leptin production appeared to be intact. The authors concluded that body composition in PWS is already disturbed in infancy, long before the development of obesity.
Van Mil et al. (2001) compared body composition in 17 patients with PWS with 17 obese control patients matched for gender and bone age. In children with PWS, adiposity was associated with reduced fat-free mass, and extracellular-to-intracellular water ratio was increased. Both findings are related to growth hormone (GH; 139250) function and physical activity. Bone mineral density, especially in the limbs, tends to be reduced in patients with PWS and is related to growth hormone function.
Gunay-Aygun et al. (2001) reviewed the sensitivity of PWS diagnostic criteria and proposed revised criteria for DNA testing. From birth to 2 years any infant with hypotonia and poor suck should have DNA testing for the PWS deletion. From age 2 to 6 years any child with hypotonia and a history of poor suck and global developmental delay should have DNA testing. From 6 years to 12 years any child with history of hypotonia and poor suck, global developmental delay, and excessive eating with central obesity should be tested for PWS.
Adolescence and Adulthood
Greenswag (1987) reported on a survey of 232 adults with PWS, ranging in age from 16 to 64 years. Of 106 patients whose chromosomes were analyzed, 54 had an abnormality of chromosome 15, primarily a deletion. Physical characteristics, health problems, intelligence, psychosocial adjustment, and impact on the family were reviewed. Emotional lability, poor gross motor skills, cognitive impairment, and insatiable hunger were especially remarkable features.
Olander et al. (2000) pointed to the occurrence of 3 PWS phenotypes: patients with paternal deletions have the typical PWS phenotype; patients with maternal UPD have a slightly milder phenotype with better cognitive function; and patients with maternal UPD and mosaic trisomy 15 have the most severe phenotype with a high incidence of congenital heart disease. They described a patient with the severe phenotype with maternal isodisomy rather than the more common maternal heterodisomy. They concluded that the more severe PWS phenotype was due to trisomy 15 mosaicism rather than to homozygosity for deleterious chromosome 15 genes.
In contrast to infants, adults invariably are small compared to their family members (Butler and Meaney, 1987). Due to high caloric intake, alimentary diabetes frequently sets in during or soon after the period of puberty. Puberty itself is diminished in PWS patients of both sexes. Adolescents and young adults often require digitalization because of cardiac insufficiency; however, it has been shown that substantial weight reduction relieves the need of cardiac therapy. Any attempt to reduce food intake in these adolescents often leads to serious psychologic and behavioral problems, and in some children, the situation in their home environment becomes intolerable (Curfs et al., 1991). Patients rarely survive beyond 25 to 30 years of age, the cause of death being diabetes and cardiac failure. However, if strict weight control is achieved, both diabetes and cardiac failure are greatly reduced and survival is either not or only mildly reduced. Johnsen et al. (1967) studied 7 mentally retarded patients, aged 4 to 19 years. Studies showed that fat synthesis from acetate during fasting was 10 times greater in patients than in unaffected sibs, and that hormone-stimulated lipolysis was depressed. These workers suggested that the condition is comparable to the genetic obese-hyperglycemic mouse. Since during fasting substrate continues to be used for new fat and lipolysis is deficient, survival depends on a continuous supply of exogenous calories. The abundant fat, muscle hypotonia, and small feet and hands are exactly the opposite of the sparse fat, muscle hypertrophy, and large hands and feet in Seip syndrome (269700).
Hoybye et al. (2002) studied the clinical, genetic, endocrinologic, and metabolic findings in 10 male and 9 female adult PWS patients (mean age, 25 years). The PWS karyotype was demonstrated in 13 patients. The mean BMI was 35.6 kg/m2, and total body fat was increased. Two-thirds were biochemically hypogonadal. Fifty percent had severe GH deficiency. Four were hypertensive. One patient had heart failure and diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance was seen in 4 patients, elevated homeostasis model assessment index in 9, and modest dyslipidemia in 7. IGF-binding protein-1 (146730) correlated negatively with insulin (176730) levels. Four patients had osteoporosis, and 11 had osteopenia. There was no significant difference between the group with the PWS karyotype and the group without the karyotype in age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, percent body fat, insulin values, homeostasis model assessment index, or lipid profile, except for lipoprotein(a) (152200), which was significantly higher in the group with the negative karyotype. Hoybye et al. (2002) concluded that the risk factors found predicting cardiovascular disease were secondary to GHD and emphasized the importance of evaluating treatment of GHD in adults with PWS.
Curfs et al. (1991) concluded that PWS patients score better on visual motor discrimination skills than on auditory verbal processing skills.
Wise et al. (1991) described 5 patients with PWS who experienced recurrent hyperthermia in infancy. On the basis of these patients and other reports of abnormal temperature regulation in PWS patients, particularly hypothermia with exposure to cold, they concluded that defects in temperature regulation may be a manifestation of hypothalamic dysfunction in PWS. On the other hand, Cassidy and McKillop (1991) concluded on the basis of a survey that clinically significant abnormal temperature control is not a common finding in this disorder. Similarly, Williams et al. (1994) concluded on the basis of a survey that the prevalence of febrile convulsions, fever-associated symptoms, and temperature less than 94 degrees F were not unique to PWS but can occur in any neurodevelopmentally handicapped individual and do not necessarily reflect syndrome-specific hypothalamic abnormalities.
Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome manifest severe skin picking behavior. Bhargava et al. (1996) described 3 adolescent patients in whom an extension of this behavior to rectal picking resulted in significant lower gastrointestinal bleeding and anal rectal disease. Recognition of this behavior is important to avoid misdiagnosing inflammatory bowel disease in PWS patients.
Wharton et al. (1997) presented 6 patients with PWS with dramatic acute gastric distention. In 3 young adult women with vomiting and apparent gastroenteritis, clinical course progressed rapidly to massive gastric dilatation and gastric necrosis. One patient died of overwhelming sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In 2 children, gastric dilatation resolved spontaneously. Gastrectomy was performed in 2 cases; in 1, gastrectomy was subtotal and distal, whereas in the other, gastrectomy was combined with partial duodenectomy and pancreatectomy. All specimens showed ischemic gastroenteritis. There was diffuse mucosal infarction with multifocal transmural necrosis.
From a study of 10 African Americans with PWS, Hudgins et al. (1998) pointed out that the clinical features differ from those of white patients. Growth is less affected, hand and foot lengths usually are normal, and the facies are atypical; as a result, PWS may be underdiagnosed in this population.
Lindgren et al. (2000) studied the microstructure of eating behavior in patients with PWS and compared it with that of members of obese and normal weight control groups of the same age. PWS patients had a mean age of 10 +/- 4 years, while the control groups were 12 +/- 3 years (normal weight) and 12 +/- 4 years (obese). Subjects with PWS had a longer duration of eating rate compared with members of both obese and normal weight groups. In subjects with PWS, 56% of the eating curves were non-decelerating, compared with 10% of the normal weight group and 30% of the obese group. Lindgren et al. (2000) concluded that the eating behavior found in subjects with PWS might be due to decreased satiation rather than increased hunger.
Nagai et al. (2000) reported standard growth curves for height and weight among Japanese children with Prader-Willi syndrome. No difference in height was seen between those with and those without chromosome 15q deletion.
Cassidy et al. (1997) personally examined and studied using molecular techniques 54 individuals with PWS to determine whether there are phenotypic differences between patients with the syndrome due to deletion (present in 37) or uniparental disomy (present in 17) as the mechanism. Previously recognized increased maternal age in patients with UPD and increased frequency of hypopigmentation in those with deletion were confirmed. Although the frequency and severity of most other manifestations of PWS did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, those with UPD were less likely to have a 'typical' facial appearance. In addition, this group was less likely to show some of the minor manifestations such as skin picking, skill with jigsaw puzzles, and high pain threshold. Females and those with UPD were also older, on average.
Gunay-Aygun et al. (2001) proposed new revised criteria for DNA testing for individuals in adolescence and adulthood. Anyone with cognitive impairment (usually mild mental retardation), excessive eating with central obesity, and hypothalamic hypogonadism, and/or typical behaviors, including temper tantrums and obsessive-compulsive features, should be referred for DNA testing for PWS.
Among 25 patients with PWS aged 18 years or older, Boer et al. (2002) found that 7 (28%) had severe affective disorder with psychotic features, with a mean age of onset of 26 years. The 7 affected persons, all aged 28 years or older, included all 5 with disomies of chromosome 15, 1 with a deletion in this chromosome, and 1 with an imprinting center mutation in the same chromosome. They postulated that in PWS, an abnormal pattern of expression of a sex-specific imprinted gene on chromosome 15 is associated with psychotic illness in early adult life.
Vogels et al. (2004) detailed the psychopathologic manifestations of 6 adults with PWS and a history of psychotic episodes. Characteristics of the psychotic disorder included early and acute onset, polymorphous and shifting symptoms, psychiatric hospitalization along with precipitating stress factors, and a prodromal phase of physiologic symptoms.
To evaluate the risk of cancer in patients with PWS, Davies et al. (2003) conducted a retrospective questionnaire survey of its occurrence among patients registered with the PWS Association compared with cases in the general US population based on the SEER program. The median age of 1,024 PWS patients was 19.0 years (range, 0.1-63 years) with 2 older than age 50. The ratio of observed (8) to expected (4.8) cancers was 1.67 (p = 0.1610; 95% CI = 0.72-3.28). Three myeloid leukemias were confirmed, resulting in a ratio of observed to expected of 40.18 (p = 0.0001; 95% CI = 8.0-117). The authors speculated that a gene within the 15q11-q13 region may be involved in the biology of myeloid leukemia or that secondary manifestations of PWS, such as obesity, may be associated with an increased risk of certain cancers.
Wey et al. (2005) described a woman with features consistent with PWS due to a mosaic imprinting defect. Three independent assays revealed a reduced proportion of nonmethylated SNURF-SNRPN alleles in peripheral blood DNA. Microsatellite analysis and FISH revealed apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental origin. Wey et al. (2005) estimated that approximately 50% of the patient's blood cells had an imprinting defect. Apart from a rather normal facial appearance, the proband had typical features of PWS in terms of truncal obesity, small hands with tapered fingers, and small feet. Operation for strabismus had been performed. When evaluated at 21 years of age, she presented with the major signs of PWS, except for the relatively normal facial appearance. Wey et al. (2005) suggested that the patient, although presenting with atypical PWS features at birth and in infancy, had progressively acquired more pronounced PWS features during childhood and adolescence.
Sinnema et al. (2012) reported the clinical features of 12 patients over the age of 50 years with genetically confirmed PWS. Eleven patients lived in a facility, and 1 lived with his elderly mother. Half of the patients had diabetes mellitus with an average age at diagnosis of 41.6 years. Three patients had hypertension, 3 had a history of stroke, 6 had a history of fractures, 10 had foot problems, 5 had scoliosis, 9 had edema, and 6 had erysipelas. Older patients had significantly lower functioning, particularly in activities of daily living, compared to younger control patients, and the decline began around age 40. All 8 patients with maternal uniparental disomy used psychotropic medications, 7 of whom had a psychiatric disorder. None of the 4 patients with a paternal deletion had a psychiatric illness. Sinnema et al. (2012) suggested that age-associated medical problems may be exacerbated by temperature instability, decreased mobility, and high pain threshold in PWS. Overall, the constellation of features suggested premature aging in PWS, which may also result from abnormalities in sex hormone levels. Sinnema et al. (2012) noted that the life expectancy of individuals with PWS had increased in recent years, and that these individuals have specific medical and social needs as they age.
To examine survival trends and risk factors in PWS, Manzardo et al. (2018) performed a survival analysis of the Prader-Willi Syndrome Association's 40-year mortality syndrome-specific database of 486 deaths. They compared 331 deaths that occurred between the years 2000 and 2015 (Recent) with 94 deaths that occurred before 2000 (Early). The risk for all-cause mortality in PWS was 1.5 (95% CI = 1.2-1.9) times higher for the Early than for the Recent cohort, reflected in female cardiac failure (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.3-2.6), pulmonary embolism (HR = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.7-22), and gastrointestinal-related (HR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.1-7.4) causes. Accidental deaths in males increased in the Recent cohort (HR = 5.7; 95% CI = 1.2-27.1), possibly due to enhanced weight management and mobility. Risk of death from respiratory failure was unchanged.
Butler et al. (2017) reviewed causes of death in Prader-Willi syndrome using the US Prader-Willi Syndrome Association 40-year mortality survey ranging from 1973 to 2015. A total of 486 deaths were reported (263 males, 217 females, 6 unknown) between 1973 and 2015, with mean age of 29.5 +/- 16 years (2 months-67 years); 70% occurred in adulthood. Respiratory failure was the most common cause, accounting for 31% of all deaths. Males were at increased risk for presumed hyperphagia-related accidents/injuries and cardiopulmonary factors compared to females. PWS maternal disomy 15 genetic subtype showed an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary factors compared to the deletion subtype.
Prader-Willi-like Syndrome Associated with Chromosome 6
Fryns et al. (1986) described an 8-month-old girl with a de novo 5q/6q autosomal translocation resulting in loss of the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q23.3-qter). Clinical manifestations included abnormal facies with broad, flat nasal bridge, small nose with broad tip, bilateral epicanthus, narrow palpebral fissures, small anteverted ears, and small mouth. Other features included truncal obesity, short hands and feet, and delayed psychomotor development. Prader-Willi syndrome was suspected initially.
Villa et al. (1995) reported a 23-month-old boy with mental and psychomotor delay, minor craniofacial abnormalities, and obesity who had a de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 6q16.2-q21. The authors noted the phenotypic similarities to Prader-Willi syndrome. In a boy with clinical features mimicking Prader-Willi syndrome, but with a normal chromosome 15, Stein et al. (1996) found a de novo interstitial deletion of 6q22.2-q23.1. The boy showed delayed development, hypotonia, seizures, hyperactive behavior, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis, small hands and feet, hypogonadism, and obesity since about 4 years of age. In a 38-year-old man with moderate to severe intellectual delay, short stature, small hands and feet, small mouth, and obesity, Smith et al. (1999) found a duplication of 6q24.3-q27. The authors noted that the phenotype showed similarities to Prader-Willi syndrome.
As reviewed by Gilhuis et al. (2000), several obese patients with cytogenetic alterations in the same region of 6q had been reported; all had in common some clinical features, including obesity, hypotonia, and developmental delays, resembling Prader-Willi syndrome. However, their behavior, facial features, and additional neurologic abnormalities, as well as a lack of cytogenetic changes or imprinting mutations on chromosome 15, clearly distinguished this PWS-like phenotype from PWS patients.
Holder et al. (2000) studied a girl with early-onset obesity and a balanced translocation between 1p22.1 and 6q16.2. At 67 months of age she weighed 47.5 kg (+9.3 SD) and was 127.2 cm tall (+3.2 SD); her weight for height was +6.3 SD. The child displayed an aggressive, voracious appetite, and the obesity was thought to be due to high intake, since measured energy expenditure was normal. However, the authors noted that apart from her obesity, there were no features suggestive of PWS. Genetic analysis of the region on chromosome 6 showed that the translocation disrupted the SIM1 gene (603128). Holder et al. (2000) hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of the SIM1 gene may be responsible for the obesity. In a boy with a Prader-Willi-like phenotype, Faivre et al. (2002) identified a deletion of chromosome 6q16.1-q21. Intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios, and a left clubfoot were noted during the third trimester of pregnancy. Later, generalized obesity, slightly dysmorphic facial features, small hands and feet, clumsiness, and mental retardation were observed. Molecular analysis showed that the deletion was paternal in origin and resulted in a deletion of the SIM1 gene.



LTBP2
**Glaucoma 3, primary congenital, D, 613086 (3)**
Firasat et al. (2008) identified 2 consanguineous Pakistani families in which PCG mapped to chromosome 14q24.2-q24.3 (GLC3D). Both families were from the Punjab province. Symptoms of PCG in one family appeared in the first 3 years of life. Symptoms in the second family were present either at birth or within the first 6 weeks of life. Visual acuity was confined to light perception and/or counting fingers in both families. Bilateral buphthalmos was present in the second family.
Ali et al. (2009) described 4 unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families with primary congenital glaucoma, including the 2 reported by Firasat et al. (2008). Affected individuals had a history of tearing and photophobia either shortly after birth or within the first 3 years of life. Most had undergone multiple failed surgical procedures and had visual acuity of counting fingers or worse. Increased intraocular pressure was evident since first presentation (up to 56 mm Hg) with corneal enlargement and clouding. Affected individuals from 3 families had mild to moderate osteopenia and high-arched palate. Some affected members had ectopia lentis, and in one family marfanoid habitus with joint hypermobility and tall stature was present in affected individuals. Ali et al. (2009) also reported 8 Gypsy individuals with GLC3D.
Narooie-Nejad et al. (2009) described 2 consanguineous Iranian families with primary congenital glaucoma. The first family had 8 affected members with onset after birth or within the first 2 years of life. Ectopia lentis in both eyes was observed in 1 patient. Ectopia lentis of the right eye and keratectasia of the left eye were observed in another patient. The second family had 2 affected sibs who had onset at birth. The older sib had corneal clouding, and the younger sib had corneal clouding and enlargement.
**Microspherophakia and/or megalocornea, with ectopia lentis and with or without secondary glaucoma, 251750 (3), AR**
Microspherophakia (MSP) is a rare disease characterized by smaller and more spherical lenses than normal bilaterally, an increased anteroposterior thickness of the lens, and highly myopic eyes. Lens dislocation or subluxation may occur, leading to defective accommodation (summary by Ben Yahia et al., 2009).
Microspherophakia may occur in association with ectopia lentis and glaucoma, Marfan syndrome (MFS; 154700), and Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS; 277600).
Ben Yahia et al. (2009) studied a sister and brother with isolated microspherophakia from a consanguineous Tunisian family. They had no cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, or metabolic disease, and there was no family history of Marfan syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, or metabolic disease. Their parents and 4 other sibs were unaffected.
Kumar et al. (2010) studied 2 consanguineous Indian families in which there were 3 brothers and a sister and brother, respectively, with microspherophakia. The 3 brothers all had unilateral lens dislocation into the vitreous cavity. The 23-year-old female presented with blurred vision and was found to have bilateral microspherophakia and secondary glaucoma, as did her 15-year-old brother. None of the 5 affected individuals had enlarged cornea, buphthalmos, abnormal angle structures, or increased axial length, excluding a diagnosis of primary congenital glaucoma in both families. None of the patients from either family had any systemic involvement.
Desir et al. (2010) described 3 sibs, born of first-cousin Moroccan parents, who had bilateral microspherophakia and megalocornea. The proband presented at 18 months of age with impaired vision and was found to have microspherophakia with bilateral lens dislocation, megalocornea, flat irides, and iridodonesis. Eye pressures were normal, and he had axial myopia. He underwent bilateral lensectomy at 2 years of age; 4 to 5 years later he had bilateral retinal detachment, and ocular hypertension developed. A sister was examined at 10 months of age due to megalocornea; she also had microspherophakia, iridodonesis, and axial myopia, with very deep anterior chambers, miotic oval pupils without well-defined borders, and normal eye pressures. She had complete posterior lens dislocation at 6 years of age, and ocular hypertension was noted at 8 years of age. Another sister presented at 18 months of age with axial myopia, megalocornea, microspherophakia without lens dislocation, iridodonesis, iris anomalies including anterior synechiae and iris mamillations, deep anterior chambers, and normal eye pressures. At 5 years of age, she had intermittent anterior dislocation of the left lens, causing acute glaucoma crises, and she underwent emergent extraction of the lens; left retinal detachment developed a few weeks later. Progressive posterior luxation of the right lens and bilateral ocular hypertension were observed. Reexamination of the proband at 14 years of age revealed an increased arm span of 204 cm with a height of 184 cm, and a decreased upper-to-lower body ratio. His hands were normal with no arachnodactyly, and the Walker and Steinberg signs were not present; Marfan syndrome (154700) was considered, but direct analysis of the FBN1 gene (134797) revealed no mutation. His affected sisters had normal upper-to-lower body ratios. Desir et al. (2010) also reported a second family of Macedonian Gypsy descent with 1 affected girl and 1 healthy boy. The girl presented at 2 years of age with megalocornea, and examination showed patchy iris atrophy and a very flat anterior chamber, with anterosuperior dislocation of microspherophakic lenses. Fundi and eye pressures were normal at that time, and her eye pressures were still normal at 3 years of age. All affected children from both families had unremarkable skin, teeth, and gums, and their hearts, valves, and aortic roots were normal by ultrasonography.
Khan et al. (2011) reported 8 affected individuals from 3 consanguineous families with congenital megalocornea and secondary glaucoma due to spherophakia and/or ectopia lentis. The authors noted that 1 patient from each family had spontaneous complete crystalline lens dislocation into the anterior chamber with acute glaucoma during early childhood, an unusual ophthalmic presentation that had previously been most strongly associated with homocystinuria (see 236200); however, homocystinuria screening in these patients was negative. In addition, 2 of the older patients had tall stature and a high-arched palate, but none of the other affected individuals had dysmorphic features, dysmorphic body habitus, or nonocular congenital anomalies.
**?Weill-Marchesani syndrome 3, recessive, 614819 (3), AR**
Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and lens abnormalities (Faivre et al., 2002).
For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of WMS, see 277600.
Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al. (2012) studied a large consanguineous Iranian family in which a brother and sister and their cousin had Weill-Marchesani syndrome, whereas 3 older sibs of the brother and sister displayed some features of WMS without meeting diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The proband was a 17-year-old boy who had ectopia lentis, myopia, elevated intraocular pressure, shallow anterior chamber, microspherophakia, short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and pulmonary and aortic stenosis. His 19-year-old sister also showed all of these features. In addition, 3 sibs had no eye findings but displayed some of the other features of WMS: a 30-year-old sister had brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and pulmonary and aortic stenosis; a 36-year-old brother had brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and pulmonary stenosis; and a 22-year-old sister had pulmonary and aortic stenosis. Their 37-year-old female cousin displayed all of the eye findings as well as brachydactyly and joint stiffness, but did not have pulmonary or aortic stenosis.
**Dental anomalies and short stature, 601216 (3), AR**
Dental anomalies and short stature (DASS) is characterized by significant short stature with brachyolmia as well as hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta with almost absent enamel (Huckert et al., 2015). Some patients exhibit valvular and/or vascular defects, including mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilation, and aortic as well as other arterial aneurysms (Dugan et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2018). Inter- and intrafamilial variability has been reported.
Verloes et al. (1996) described an apparently 'new' form of skeletal dysplasia with amelogenesis imperfecta and platyspondyly in a brother and sister born of consanguineous parents. Hallmarks were amelogenesis imperfecta (absence of the enamel cap) associated with short trunk and brachyolmia-like anomalies (platyspondyly with short pedicles, narrow intervertebral and interpedicular distances, rectangular-shaped vertebrae with posterior scalloping, herniation of the nuclei, and broad femoral necks). Inheritance appeared to be autosomal recessive. The girl was 141 cm tall at age 16, with an arm span of 142 cm, a sitting height of 72 cm, and short hands. She was completely edentulous, all teeth having to be removed within a year of eruption. At the age of 12 years, the brother was 133 cm tall with sitting height of 63 cm and arm span of 134 cm. The permanent teeth were yellowish and almost completely lacking in enamel cap.
Bertola et al. (2009) described 3 affected patients (2 sibs and 1 unrelated patient), from consanguineous matings, presenting with brachyolmia with enamel defects. In the first family, the older brother had oligodontia and enamel hypoplasia; the younger brother had widely spaced permanent teeth, enamel hypoplasia, agenesis of both inferior second premolars and retention of their deciduous. In the second family, the patient had retarded eruption of permanent teeth, amelogenesis imperfecta, and taurodontic pulp chambers.
Noor et al. (2009) reported a consanguineous Pakistani family in which 5 sibs had selective tooth agenesis characterized by absence of many of the permanent teeth. Two affected males were examined in detail. Radiographs showed apparent congenital oligodontia, with absence of 23 permanent teeth in the more severely affected brother, and absence of 18 permanent teeth in the other affected brother. Fully formed impacted upper third molars were identified bilaterally, and fully formed unerupted unilateral lower second and third molars were seen; no completely or incompletely formed impacted nonmolar teeth were noted. Alveolar bone was absent where the teeth were missing, an area encompassing most of the mandible. Radiographic studies and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) suggested that affected individuals had a higher bone mineral density in the spine, as well as an increase in bone density at the base of the skull, compared to unaffected individuals. There was apparent prognathism on lateral skull film (Figure 1). Affected individuals also had short stature with varying degrees of scoliosis, although the relationship of this finding to the genotype was unclear.
Dugan et al. (2015) reported 2 sisters of Emirati origin who had 'small and decayed' deciduous teeth, over which crowns were placed when neither had eruption of permanent teeth. Both girls had short stature, and neither responded to growth hormone (GH1; 139250) administration. Both were diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in childhood, and follow-up echocardiography in the teenage years showed MVP with mild insufficiency in both. Other features included hypertrichosis, especially on the back, and short first metatarsals; the older sister exhibited arachnodactyly and swan-neck deformity of the fingers on extension, whereas the younger sister had the swan-neck deformity without arachnodactyly.
Huckert et al. (2015) studied 2 sisters, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, who presented with amelogenesis imperfecta and short stature. Examination revealed facial dysmorphism, including large forehead, thick eyebrows, and almond-shaped eyes, as well as myopia and learning difficulties. Skeletal x-rays showed platyspondyly with indentations of both upper and lower vertebral endplates (brachyolmia), but there were no signs of a generalized skeletal dysplasia, and bone age was normal. Orodental evaluation revealed nearly complete absence of enamel in both primary and permanent dentitions. Teeth were yellow, small, and widely spaced, and several teeth had been extracted due to recurrent infection. On orthopantomogram, no enamel was seen, pulp chambers were large, and molars were taurodontic. Lateral skull x-rays showed somewhat thickened cortical plates of the frontal bone with absence of pneumatization of the frontal and sphenoid sinuses, as well as class III mandibular prognathism, due to maxillary underdevelopment. Huckert et al. (2015) also studied patients from 3 more families with amelogenesis imperfecta, short stature, and variable platyspondyly, including a patient originally reported by Bertola et al. (2009). Delayed tooth eruption and missing teeth were each noted in 1 family, respectively, and patients in 1 family also exhibited osteopenia and scoliosis. Huckert et al. (2015) noted that the published skull x-ray of 1 of the Pakistani family members with selective tooth agenesis studied by Noor et al. (2009) clearly showed absent enamel and short roots in the remaining teeth, suggesting a diagnosis of amelogenesis imperfecta.
Clinical Variability
Guo et al. (2018) reported 2 unrelated families with DASS and mutations in the LTBP3 gene (see MOLECULAR GENETICS), in which affected individuals also exhibited thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms. In the first family (family TAA909), the proband was a 54-year-old man with DASS and aortic root dilation, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and multiple visceral and peripheral arterial aneurysms. His 2 affected sisters had DASS with mild mitral valve prolapse, and 1 also showed mild aortic root dilation. In the second family (family TAA376), a brother and sister had DASS and aneurysm of the ascending aorta with dissection in the fourth decade of life, as well as involvement of the descending aorta. In the sister, aneurysmal disease extended to the abdominal aorta, and she also had cervical artery tortuosity, pulmonary artery dilation, other arterial aneurysms, and mitral valve disease. Their parents were unaffected, but 2 paternal aunts and 1 uncle had thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection in the eighth and ninth decades of life, and 2 of the 3 were also known to have dental anomalies. Three other paternal relatives of that generation died suddenly of unknown cause in the sixth and seventh decades of life, one of whom had dental abnormalities.
**Geleophysic dysplasia 3, 617809 (3), AD**
McInerney-Leo et al. (2016) studied a mother (SKDP-4.2) and 2 sons (SKDP-4.4 and SKDP-4.3) who had short stature, brachydactyly, restricted movements in the elbow and wrist joints, and dysmorphic facial features including round face, full cheeks, well-defined eyebrows, bulbous nose, anteverted nares, and thick lips. The mother underwent emergency tracheostomy after failed intubation for cesarean section; CT scan indicated probable preexisting subglottic stenosis. In addition, the younger son had a hoarse voice and subglottic stenosis, and echocardiogram at age 16 years showed mildly thickened mitral valve with mitral regurgitation, and possible pulmonary artery stenosis; however, these results were not confirmed on cardiac MRI. The family was clinically diagnosed with acromicric dysplasia (see 102370). The authors also reported 2 unrelated boys (GD-1 and GD-2) with facial features of geleophysic dysplasia, short stature, small hands and feet, stiff joints, thick skin, dyspnea, sleep apnea, tracheolaryngeal stenosis, and hepatomegaly. Both boys developed alveolointerstitial pneumonia and died of respiratory failure, at age 4 years and age 18 months, respectively.

RIMS1
**Cone-rod dystrophy 7, 603649 (3)**
Kelsell et al. (1998) described a 4-generation British family with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy. Affected members first became aware of reduced color vision and visual acuity between the ages of 20 and 40 years. As the disorder progressed, they reported difficulty seeing in bright light. At the onset of symptoms, retinal pigmentary changes were already present around the fovea, simulating a bull's eye dystrophy, and progressed to macular atrophy.
Kniazeva et al. (1999) examined 10 members of a 4-generation family segregating an autosomal dominant form of macular dystrophy and identified 5 individuals with characteristic features of cone-rod dystrophy and Stargardt disease; a sixth family member (deceased) was classified as affected by history. Most affected individuals had gradual onset of decreased visual acuity during the fourth decade, bilateral macular atrophy, diffusely abnormal ERG responses, and markedly reduced color vision. In addition, several affected individuals demonstrated features highly suggestive of Stargardt-like disease (see 248200), such as yellow 'flavimaculatus flecks' in the retinal pigment epithelium and a 'dark choroid' pattern on fluorescein angiography.



FMN2
**Mental retardation, autosomal recessive 47, 616193 (3), AR**
Law et al. (2014) reported 5 patients from 2 unrelated consanguineous families with nonsyndromic mental retardation. All patients showed delayed development, with cognition and speech more affected than motor skills. Two patients had hypotonia. Speech was limited to a few words in most patients. Two patients had controlled complex partial seizures. At 14 to 30 years of age, all except 1 were dependent for activities of daily living. Brain imaging in 2 patients was normal; there were no additional neurologic or dysmorphic features.



TYR
**Albinism, oculocutaneous, type IA, 203100 (3), AR**
Oculocutaneous albinism is a genetically heterogeneous congenital disorder characterized by decreased or absent pigmentation in the hair, skin, and eyes. The term 'albinism' includes specific ocular changes that are the results of reduced amounts of melanin in the developing eye; these abnormalities in the eye and optic system are specific and necessary for the diagnosis. Aside from decreased pigment in the iris and retina, optic changes include decreased visual acuity, misrouting of the optic nerves at the chiasm, and nystagmus (King et al., 2001).
Although OCA caused by mutations in the TYR gene was classically known as 'tyrosinase-negative' OCA, Tripathi et al. (1992) noted that some patients with 'tyrosinase-positive' OCA may indeed have TYR mutations resulting in residual enzyme activity. These patients can be classified as having OCA1B.
Genetic Heterogeneity of Oculocutaneous Albinism
OCA1, caused by mutations in the TYR gene, is divided clinically into 2 types: type IA, OCA1A, characterized by complete lack of tyrosinase activity due to production of an inactive enzyme, and type IB (OCA1B; 606952), characterized by reduced activity of tyrosinase. OCA2 (203200), OCA3 (203290), and OCA4 (606574) are somewhat milder forms of the disorder, caused by mutations in the OCA2 (611409), TYRP1 (115501), and MATP (SLC45A2; 606202) genes, respectively. OCA5 (615312) has been mapped to chromosome 4q24. OCA6 (see 113750) is caused by mutation in the SLC24A5 gene (609802). OCA7 (615179) is caused by mutation in the C10ORF11 gene (614537).
See also ocular albinism (OA1; 300500), which is restricted phenotypically to ocular involvement only.
Taylor (1978) pointed out that in the albino the ganglion cell layer does not thin out in the foveolar pit but shows a layer 6 to 8 cells thick where there should be none. He commented that 'this must degrade the retinal image....There is therefore ample reason for the uncorrectable defective central fixation, and...the ocular nystagmus, in this case of the optical variety.' In 60% of his patients he noted an abnormal head posture, which minimized the nystagmus with slight improvement in visual acuity, at least for reading. All types of conditions with oculocutaneous or ocular hypopigmentation in man and animals with nystagmus tested to date have shown either electrophysiologic or anatomic evidence of a decussation defect in the optic tracts. Patients without nystagmus do not (Witkop et al., 1982).
Evidence that anomalous decussation exists also in the auditory system was presented by Creel et al. (1980). The amount of pigment in the inner ear correlates directly with the amount in the iris; otic pigment is lacking in albinos. In homozygotes an abnormal proportion of fibers from the ganglion cells of the temporal retina decussate to the contralateral cerebral hemisphere; this can be demonstrated by monocular visual evoked potential (VEP) asymmetry (Apkarian et al., 1983).
Van Dorp (1987) suggested that patients with autosomal recessive albinism may have normal pigmentation. In a family with several albinos, they found a cousin, the offspring of a consanguineous mating, who was normally pigmented but had absence of macromelanosomes on skin biopsy as well as ocular and electrophysiologic signs of albinism. Van Dorp (1987) also concluded that patients with X-linked ocular albinism (300500, 300600) may be generally underpigmented and that patients with the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) may have a dark complexion.
Summers et al. (1991) observed striking discordance in ocular expression of albinism in 2 brothers. Both had foveal hypoplasia and misrouting of the optic fibers at the chiasm, as judged by VEP: one had strabismus and nystagmus with maximum correction of vision to 20/100, whereas the other had vision with myopic correction to 20/20 in both eyes and no nystagmus or strabismus.
Using MRI, Schmitz et al. (2003) found that the size and configuration of the optic chiasm in humans with albinism are distinctly different from the chiasms of normal control subjects. These chiasmal changes reflect the atypical crossing of the optic fibers, irrespective of the causative gene mutation. Eight patients had tyrosinase gene-related oculocutaneous albinism, 4 patients had pink-eyed dilution gene-related OCA2 (203200), 1 had ocular albinism (OA1; 300500); the albinism-causing mutation had not been identified in 4 other patients.
Summers and King (1994) described minimal pigment oculocutaneous albinism, a tyrosinase-related form of the disorder. They reported the findings in 9 patients followed for up to 11 years. Patients were born with white scalp hair and skin, and nystagmus developed. Visual acuity was reduced, but in 1 patient vision improved with maturity. The irides were blue. In 7 of the 9 patients, including the 1 patient with improved visual acuity, iris pigment developed as demonstrated by transillumination with slit-lamp biomicroscopy.
Meyer et al. (2002) found that optical coherence tomography (OCT) could be used to document foveal hypoplasia in patients with oculocutaneous albinism. In a patient with OCA, the OCT did not detect a foveal pit; instead, widespread thickening of the retina occurred throughout the entire fovea with no difference from the surrounding macula. Foveal thickness was 300 micrometers in the patient versus 150 micrometers in a normal subject. Recchia et al. (2002) also found that OCT allowed detailed examination of the macular anatomy in patients with foveal hypoplasia. Their patient's OCT data showed preservation of multiple inner retinal layers where there should have been none, indicating that the fovea was thicker than normal. The authors proposed that a more accurate term would be 'foveal dysgenesis,' and suggested that OCT might prove helpful in the evaluation of patients with unexplained visual loss.
Albinism is associated with a variety of ophthalmologic signs, including iris transillumination, nystagmus, strabismus, high refractive errors, foveal dysgenesis, chorioretinal hypopigmentation, and the 'albinotic' optic disc. Brodsky and Fray (2004) reported that a positive angle kappa is also associated with albinism in patients with congenital nystagmus. The authors suggested that this association might be related to the anomalous decussation of the optic axons that characterizes the albinotic visual system.
**Albinism, oculocutaneous, type IB, 606952 (3)**
Oculocutaneous albinism type I is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by absence of pigment in hair, skin, and eyes, and does not vary with race or age. Severe nystagmus, photophobia, and reduced visual acuity are common features. OCA type I is divided into 2 types: type IA, characterized by complete lack of tyrosinase activity due to production of an inactive enzyme, and type IB, characterized by reduced activity of tyrosinase.
Although OCA caused by mutations in the TYR gene was classically known as 'tyrosinase-negative' OCA, Tripathi et al. (1992) noted that some patients with 'tyrosinase-positive' OCA may indeed have TYR mutations resulting in residual enzyme activity. These patients can be classified as having OCA1B.
Witkop (1971) suggested that the 'yellow mutant' (ym) form of albinism first observed among the Amish (Nance et al., 1970) and later observed in non-Amish families (Witkop et al., 1971) may be distinct from both tyrosinase-positive and tyrosinase-negative albinism. As in type II albinism (203200), the homozygote is 'dead white' at birth, with serious ocular abnormalities, but rather rapidly develops normal skin pigmentation and yellow hair. The condition differs from albinism II in the yellow hair and the fact that incubation with L-tyrosine or L-DOPA yields equivocal results.
Hu et al. (1980) described 3 sisters, including monozygotic twins, with clinical, ultrastructural, and histochemical features typical of yellow mutant albinism. Classic tyrosinase-negative albinism was found in a maternal cousin of the probands. The authors suggested that the probands are genetic compounds for the yellow mutant allele and the classic albinism allele.
King et al. (1986) reported 3 families in which affected individuals had white hair and no skin or eye pigment at birth, but developed minimal amounts of pigment in the iris in the first decade of life. They had no measurable hairbulb tyrosinase activity. The authors referred to this as 'minimal pigment' type albinism. In each of the families, one parent had normal tyrosinase activity and the other abnormally low activity. King et al. (2001) stated that early descriptions of 'minimal pigment' and 'platinum'-type albinism are now considered likely to be part of the OCA1B spectrum. While most affected individuals with OCA1B have blue eyes at birth, they can develop visible light tan or brown pigment over time.
King et al. (2001) discussed changes in the optic system common to all individuals affected with oculocutaneous albinism. Melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is greatly reduced or absent, making the retina transparent; as a result, the choroidal blood vessels may be seen on ophthalmoscopic examination. Foveal hypoplasia results in reduced visual acuity, and correction of refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism), which are common and significant, often improves acuity modestly. The most striking optic system change in albinism is the abnormal decussation and misrouting of the optic fibers at the chiasm, resulting in loss of stereoscopic depth perception. Asymmetric visual evoked potential, which is evidence of misrouting, is diagnostic for albinism.
Albinism is associated with a variety of ophthalmologic signs, including iris transillumination, nystagmus, strabismus, high refractive errors, foveal dysgenesis, chorioretinal hypopigmentation, and the 'albinotic' optic disc. Brodsky and Fray (2004) reported that a positive angle kappa, with the appearance of exotropia but no fixation shift on alternate cover test, is also associated with albinism in patients with congenital nystagmus. The authors suggested that this association might be related to the anomalous decussation of the optic axons that characterizes the albinotic visual system.
Temperature-Sensitive Phenotype
King et al. (1991) reported a patient with white hair in the warmer areas (scalp and axilla) and progressively darker hair in the cooler areas (extremities) of her body. Tyrosinase assay demonstrated a loss of activity above 35-37 degrees C. The authors noted that the pattern of peripheral pigmentation is analogous to the Siamese cat and the Himalayan mouse.
Ocular Albinism with Waardenburg Syndrome Type 2A
Lewis (1978) found 7 affected males and 5 affected females in 3 consecutive generations of a Caucasian kindred. As in the X-linked Nettleship-Falls form of ocular albinism (300500), the patients showed reduced visual acuity, photophobia, nystagmus, translucent irides, strabismus, hypermetropic refractive errors, and albinotic fundus with foveal hypoplasia. The skin lesions showed macromelanosomes as in X-linked ocular albinism. Deafness, which was accompanied by vestibular hypofunction, lentigines even in unexposed areas, optic nerve dysplasia, and dominant inheritance distinguished this form of ocular albinism. (In the LEOPARD syndrome (151100) vestibular function is normal.)
Bard (1978) described a kindred that was atypical of Waardenburg syndrome (see 193510) in several ways. Although the nasal root was prominent, one affected person had dystopia of the inner canthi or lower puncta. The face in some showed striking freckling of pale skin. Symptomatic vestibular disturbance was another unusual feature. Lewis (1989) expressed the opinion that the family reported by Bard (1978) as an instance of Waardenburg syndrome in fact had this disorder. Lewis (1989) had also been told of 2 other small families with the syndrome. Goldberg (1966) described a Waardenburg syndrome family with apparent ocular albinism.
Morell et al. (1997) presented an update of the clinical findings in the family of Bard (1978). The deafness was sensorineural and congenital. Heterochromia iridis was a prominent feature in 1 sibship in which both segmental iris bicolor and complete heterochromia occurred. Most of the affected individuals showed transillumination defects of the iris. Hypopigmentation of the fundus was mild in some, moderate in others, and severe in yet others. Almost all affected individuals had strabismus and visual acuity defects. One individual with a prominent white forelock, characteristic of Waardenburg syndrome, was pictured. In this family, Morell et al. (1997) identified digenic inheritance of Waardenburg syndrome and oculocutaneous albinism; see MOLECULAR GENETICS.

PKHD1
**Polycystic kidney disease 4, with or without hepatic disease, 263200 (3), AR**
PKD4 is an autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) characterized by enlarged, echogenic kidneys with fusiform dilatation of the collecting ducts. Most patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but at varying ages. Patients also have liver disease consisting of dilated biliary ducts, congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF), and portal hypertension (Caroli disease). The most typical disease expression occurs in neonates and includes a history of oligohydramnios, massively enlarged kidneys, and the 'Potter' sequence with pulmonary hypoplasia that leads to respiratory insufficiency and perinatal death in approximately 30% of affected newborns (summary by Hartung and Guay-Woodford, 2014).
For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of polycystic kidney disease, see PKD1 (173900).
Ward et al. (2002) briefly reviewed clinical features and classification of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The disease presentation of ARPKD is highly variable. In infancy, the disease results in significantly enlarged echogenic polycystic kidneys, with pulmonary hypoplasia resulting from oligohydramnios as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Liver involvement is detectable in approximately 45% of infants and is often the major feature in older patients. The pathologic findings of collecting-duct ectasia in the kidney and ductal-plate malformation in the liver indicates that the basic defect of ARPKD may be a failure of terminal differentiation in the collecting-duct and biliary systems. The variable clinical presentation led to earlier separation into different clinicopathologic groups: perinatal, neonatal, infantile, and juvenile, depending on the age of presentation and the severity of renal and liver disease (Blyth and Ockenden, 1971), suggesting different genetic entities; see HISTORY. Subsequently, evidence of intrafamilial phenotypic variability (Kaplan et al., 1988; Deget et al., 1995) and genetic linkage studies (Zerres et al., 1994; Guay-Woodford et al., 1995) suggested that a less rigid subdivision is indicated, with allelic, rather than genetic, heterogeneity explaining much of the observed variability (Zerres et al., 1998).
It has long been recognized that the age distribution of cases of polycystic kidneys has 2 peaks, one at birth and one between ages 30 to 60 years. Furthermore, most cases with the later peak show the familial pattern of an autosomal dominant (173900). Kaariainen (1987) collected information in Finland on 82 children treated during the years 1974 to 1983 for polycystic kidney disease. The frequency was about 1 per 8,000 births. Early lethal disease was present in 51, whereas 31 survived for over 28 days. The children came from 69 families. They were divided by family studies into 3 groups: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in 11 families, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in 14, and sporadic cases in 44 families. In 3 of the 'dominant' families, 2 or more sibs had manifestations of PKD neonatally. The majority of the grandparents of the children with the recessive or the sporadic form were born in the same sparsely populated areas in northern, central, and eastern Finland, which suggested that most of the sporadic cases were actually recessive PKD.
One of the notable features of both dominant and recessive PKD in humans is the variability of the phenotype, with respect to both disease progression and extrarenal manifestations. While a significant component of this variance is probably due to genetic heterogeneity, Kaplan et al. (1989) documented marked variability of clinical disease even within kindreds. Kaplan et al. (1988) presented evidence contradicting the view that perinatal, neonatal, infantile, and juvenile forms of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease represent 4 discrete entities. They described an instructive family in which a male infant presented at birth with very large cystic kidneys together with portal fibrosis and ductule proliferation in the liver, bilateral pulmonary atelectasis, large atrial septal defect, and a ventricular septal defect. Death occurred at 18 hours. An older sib presented at the age of 16 years with no symptoms because the mother wanted reassurance that the daughter had no condition similar to that of the deceased sib. Blood pressure was normal. The liver and spleen were enlarged. Ultrasonography, radiologic studies, and liver biopsy showed renal tubular ectasia and congenital hepatic fibrosis. Thus, the perinatal and juvenile forms of Blyth and Ockenden (1971) are likely to be opposite ends of the phenotypic spectrum of a single entity.
Zerres et al. (1984) gave a comprehensive review of all types of cystic kidney. They stated that evidence of so-called congenital hepatic fibrosis is 'indispensable for the diagnosis of ARPKD.' Hartung and Guay-Woodford (2014) noted that although histologic biliary abnormalities are a universal feature of ARPKD, clinical expression varies widely. In various cohorts, the proportion of ARPKD patients with imaging findings of liver disease has ranged from 45 to 90%.
Gross cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree is usually called Caroli disease (congenital biliary ectasia, or nonobstructive intrahepatic bile duct dilatation; see 600643); its frequent association with ARPKD is well established (Bernstein et al., 1975). Caroli disease is a rare cause of chronic cholestasis and hepatolithiasis in young adults. Ros et al. (1993) reported results of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in 12 patients with Caroli disease and intrahepatic stones. The duodenal bile of these patients contained cholesterol crystals which suggested that the stones were cholesterol rich. UDCA led to sustained clinical remission, return to normal liver function, and dissolution of intrahepatic stones on ultrasound in all patients. Tsuchida et al. (1995) described Caroli disease in a brother and sister whose asymptomatic father was shown to have the same disease by CT scan. They suggested that the mode of inheritance in this family and in many other instances is autosomal dominant, not autosomal recessive. The sister had undergone laparotomy at the age of 5 years because of hepatomegaly and mottled radiopacities shown by cholangiography. With medical management she remained in good health for the next 21 years. Mottled radiopacities of the hepatic parenchyma were demonstrated by cholangiography in her 9-year-old brother at the time the diagnosis of Caroli disease was made in the sister. He remained asymptomatic, however, until hematemesis due to esophageal varices occurred 21 years later at the age of 30 years. While their healthy father was at that time shown to have the same disease by CT scan, the mother of the affected sibs had a completely normal intrahepatic biliary tree by intravenous cholangiography. Presumably, there was no cystic involvement of the kidneys in any of the 3 affected members of the family. If Caroli disease is defined simply as polycystic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts with hepatic fibrosis, it is likely that not all cases have this disorder as part of either infantile or adult polycystic kidney disease. It is possible that some cases represent a distinct entity of isolated hepatic fibrosis with cysts and that some of these represent a distinct genetic entity in its own right (see 600643). However, Adeva et al. (2006) concluded that relatively isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis and/or Caroli disease are part of the ARPKD spectrum.
Deget et al. (1995) observed 42 children from 20 sibships with ARPKD, pro- and retrospectively, over a mean period of 3.7 years. Using the subclassification of Blyth and Ockenden (1971), they assigned 12 patients to the perinatal, 9 to the neonatal, 13 to the infantile, and 8 to the juvenile category. In 11 of the 20 families, different subtypes were observed among affected sibs; in 7 families, affected sibs belonged to adjacent subgroups, while major intrafamilial differences were observed in 4 families. The phenotypic manifestations ranged from stillbirths to mildly affected adults, while intrafamilial variability of the clinical picture was generally small with multiple allelism as the most likely genetic explanation. Age at death showed gross variation in 8 sibships. Sex influence could not explain the differences in clinical course between sibs.
Blickman et al. (1995) reported the sonographic changes in renal function seen on long-term follow-up of children who had the initial diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease made in the neonatal period. The evaluation involved 14 children with biopsy evidence of the disease; 9 children who survived the neonatal period were followed up for a mean of 13 years (range, 5-19 years) after diagnosis. They found that kidney size as seen on sonograms did not continue to increase despite the patients' linear growth and maintained normal renal function. Rather, a decrease in kidney size and change in echogenicity occurred, producing a pattern similar to that seen on sonograms of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease but without the marked increase in kidney size that occurs in that entity. The authors thought that the changing cystic pattern on follow-up sonograms may have been the reason that previous descriptions have varied and why a decrease in size may not herald deteriorating renal function.
Coffman (2002) commented on the elucidation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease by Ward et al. (2002). They published photographs of gross and microscopic views of a specimen from a patient with ARPKD showing the typical pattern of fusiform, cylindrical channels occupying most of the kidney parenchyma and representing massively dilated terminal branches of collecting ducts. A photomicrograph showed the radially oriented, fusiform cysts characteristic of ARPKD.
Bosch et al. (2003) described clinical and renal function stabilization in a 3-year-old Turkish female who survived neonatal onset without hepatic fibrosis, thereby illustrating that prognostication should be cautious even with severe neonatal presentation.
Guay-Woodford and Desmond (2003) analyzed the largest single group of patients with ARPKD (The ARPKD Clinical Database) which was divided into a younger cohort of 166 patients born after January 1, 1990 (median age 5.4 years, 45.8% detected prenatally) and an older cohort of 43 patients born before 1990 biased for long-term survival (median age 14 years, 5.6% detected prenatally). They found a slower rate of disease progression in the older cohort, as assessed by age of ARPKD diagnosis, as well as age of diagnosis of clinical morbidities. Neonatal ventilation was strongly predictive of mortality as well as an earlier age of diagnosis in those who developed systemic hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. However, for those who survived the perinatal period, the long-term prognosis for survival was much better than generally perceived; 1- and 5-year survival was approximately 90% for those who survived the first month of life. Portal hypertension was not correlated with age at diagnosis, and only a small subset of patients developed clinically significant periportal fibrosis.
Bergmann et al. (2005) examined the clinical course of 164 neonatal survivors out of 186 ARPKD patients from 126 unrelated families. The mean observation period was 6 years (range, 0-35 years), and the 1- and 10-year survival rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Chronic renal failure was first detected at a mean age of 4 years, with actuarial renal survival rates of 86% at 5 years, 71% at 10 years, and 42% at 20 years. All but 6 patients (92%) had a kidney length on or above the 97th centile for age. About 75% of the study population developed systemic hypertension. Sequelae of congenital hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension developed in 44% of patients and were related to age. Positive correlations observed between renal and hepatobiliary-related morbidity suggested uniform disease progression rather than organ-specific patterns. Bergmann et al. (2005) noted that missense changes were more frequently observed among patients with a milder clinical course, whereas chain-terminating mutations were more commonly associated with a severe phenotype.
Adeva et al. (2006) commented that the autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease had generally been considered an infantile disorder with typical presentation of greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys detected in utero or within the neonatal period, often resulting in neonatal demise; however, there was an increasing realization that survivors often thrived into adulthood with complications of ductal plate malformation, manifesting as congenital hepatic fibrosis and Caroli disease, becoming prominent. Adeva et al. (2006) retrospectively reviewed the clinical records, and where possible performed PKHD1 mutation screening, in patients diagnosed with ARPKD or congenital hepatic fibrosis at the Mayo Clinic in the period 1961 to 2004. Of 133 cases reviewed, 65 were considered to meet the diagnostic criteria, with an average duration of follow-up of 8.6 +/- 6.4 years. ARPKD was present in 55 cases and 10 had isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis with no or minimal renal involvement. The patients were analyzed in 3 groups categorized by the age at diagnosis: less than 1 year (22 patients), 1 to 20 years (23 patients), and more than 20 years (20 patients). The presenting feature in the neonates was typically associated with renal enlargement, but in the older groups more often involved manifestations of liver disease, including hepatosplenomegaly, hypersplenism, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis. During follow-up, 22 patients had renal insufficiency and 8 developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD), most from the neonatal group. Liver disease was evident on follow-up in all diagnostic groups but particularly prevalent in those diagnosed later in life. In all, 12 patients died, 6 in the neonatal period, but 86% of patients were alive at 40 years of age. The likelihood of being alive without ESRD differed significantly between the diagnostic groups with 36%, 80%, and 88% survival in the 3 groups, respectively, 20 years after the diagnosis. Considerable intrafamilial phenotypic variability was observed. Mutation analysis was performed in 31 families and at least 1 mutation was detected in 25 (81%), with 76% mutant alleles detected in those cases. Consistent with the relatively mild disease manifestations in this group of patients, most of the mutations were missense (79%) and no case had 2 truncating changes. Mutations were detected in all diagnostic groups, indicating that congenital hepatic fibrosis with minimal kidney involvement can result from PKHD1 mutation. No mutations were detected in 6 cases.

**Breast cancer, somatic, 114480 (3)**
Breast cancer (referring to mammary carcinoma, not mammary sarcoma) is histopathologically and almost certainly etiologically and genetically heterogeneous. Important genetic factors have been indicated by familial occurrence and bilateral involvement.
Cady (1970) described a family in which 3 sisters had bilateral breast cancer. Together with reports in the literature, this suggested to him the existence of families with a particular tendency to early-onset, bilateral breast cancer. The genetic basis might, of course, be multifactorial.
Anderson (1974) concluded that the sisters of women with breast cancer whose mothers also had breast cancer have a risk 47 to 51 times that in control women; a revised estimate was 39 times (Anderson, 1976). The disease in these women usually developed before menopause, was often bilateral, and seemed to be associated with ovarian function. About 30% of daughters with early-onset, bilateral breast cancer inherited the susceptibility. The risk of breast cancer to women with affected relatives is higher when the diagnosis is made at an early age and when the disease is bilateral. Ottman et al. (1983) provided tables that give the cumulative risk of breast cancer to mothers and sisters at various ages. The highest risk group is sisters of premenstrual probands with bilateral disease. Among the sisters of women with breast cancer, Anderson and Badzioch (1985) found the highest lifetime risks when the proband had bilateral disease, an affected mother (25 +/- 7.2%), or an affected sister (28 +/- 11%). The risks were reduced to 18 +/- 3.3% and 14 +/- 2.6%, respectively, with unilateral disease. An early example of familial breast cancer was provided by Broca (1866). According to the pedigree drawn by Lynch (1976), 10 women in 4 generations of the family of Broca's wife died of breast cancer. Eisinger et al. (1998) called attention to an even earlier report of hereditary breast cancer by Le Dran (1757), who related the experience of a colleague in Avignon who had diagnosed a 19-year-old nun with cancer of the right breast. The patient refused a mastectomy not only because of the pain of surgery, but also because of a belief that the operation would be futile. Her grandmother and a grandmaternal uncle died with breast cancer, and she was convinced that this malady was hereditary and that 'her blood was corrupted by a cancerous ferment natural to her family.'
Two families with an extraordinary incidence of male breast cancer and father-to-son transmission of same was reported by Everson et al. (1976). They found a suggestion of elevated urinary estrogen in 3 of the affected males. Teasdale et al. (1976) described breast cancer in 2 brothers and in a daughter of 1 brother. Kozak et al. (1986) reported breast cancer in 2 related males, an uncle and nephew. In this family and in several reported families with male breast cancer, Kozak et al. (1986) found women in the same family with breast cancer.
Soft tissue sarcomas are associated with breast cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Mulvihill (1982) used the term cancer family syndrome of Lynch (120435) for the association of colon and endometrial carcinoma and other neoplasms including breast cancer.
Seltzer et al. (1990) concluded that dermatoglyphics can help in the identification of women either with or at risk for breast cancer. They found that the presence of 6 or more whorls is associated in a statistically significant manner with breast cancer.
Marger et al. (1975) presented the cases of 2 brothers with breast cancer and reviewed the courses of 28 other previously unreported male patients. In one of the brothers, breast cancer was preceded by prostate cancer and estrogen administration, raising the possibility that the breast cancer was a metastatic deposit. The possibility of prostatic metastases was raised in 2 other patients. Demeter et al. (1990) reported breast cancer in a 64-year-old man who had had bilateral gynecomastia since childhood. His maternal grandfather had been found to have adenocarcinoma of the breast at the age of 65. His maternal grandmother had radical mastectomy for breast cancer at the age of 66 and 2 years later underwent radiation therapy for rib metastases. The proband's sister developed breast cancer at the age of 31 years and despite aggressive therapy died 1 year later with extensive metastases.
Hauser et al. (1992) reported a family in which 2 females and 2 males in 2 generations had breast cancer. Two females in the family had prophylactic bilateral mastectomy at a young age. One male developed a left breast mass and axillary node at age 59 and died of metastatic disease at age 62. His paternal uncle presented at age 57 years with bleeding from his right breast. Biopsy suggested Paget disease of the breast and he underwent mastectomy. He subsequently died at age 75 years of prostatic carcinoma. He had a daughter who developed breast cancer at age 27 years and died at age 30 with disseminated disease, and a son who developed infiltrating grade 4 adenocarcinoma of the breast at age 54.
**Estrogen resistance, 615363 (3), AR**
Estrogen resistance (ESTRR) is characterized by absence of puberty with elevated estradiol and gonadotropic hormones, as well as markedly delayed bone maturation. Female patients show absent breast development, small uterus, and enlarged multicystic ovaries; male patients may show small testes (Bernard et al., 2017). Some patients exhibit continued growth into adulthood (Smith et al., 1994).
Smith et al. (1994) described a 28-year-old man with estrogen resistance. He was 204 cm tall and had incomplete epiphyseal closure, with a history of continued linear growth into adulthood despite otherwise normal pubertal development. He was normally masculinized and had bilateral axillary acanthosis nigricans. Serum estradiol and estrone concentrations were elevated, and serum testosterone concentrations were normal. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations were increased. Glucose tolerance was impaired and hyperinsulinemia was present. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was 3.1 SD below the mean for age-matched normal women; there was no biochemical evidence of increased bone turnover. Administration of estrogen had no detectable effect. Smith et al. (1994) concluded that estrogen is important for bone maturation and mineralization in men as well as in women.
Sudhir et al. (1997) presented further clinical and laboratory findings from the man originally reported by Smith et al. (1994). Electron-beam CT scanning of the patient at age 31 years showed evidence of early atherosclerosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Abnormal serum lipid concentrations were thought to reflect estrogen insensitivity. The authors concluded that the absence of functional estrogen receptors might be a novel risk factor for coronary artery disease in men.
Smith et al. (2008) performed a follow-up of the propositus with a homozygous nonsense mutation in ESR1 (see MOLECULAR GENETICS) originally reported by Smith et al. (1994), combined with an assessment of the effect of heterozygosity on spine density and adult height in members of his extended kindred. Patient bone biopsy revealed marked osteopenia, low trabecular volume, decreased thickness, normal trabecular number, and low activation frequency. Trabecular and cortical volumetric bone densities were markedly lower than controls. Heterozygous mutation carriers had mean spine aBMD Z scores that were significantly less than zero (p = 0.003), but spine aBMD Z scores were similar among carrier and noncarrier family members. The authors concluded that homozygous ESR1 disruption markedly affects bone growth, mineral content, and structure, but not periosteal circumference, whereas heterozygosity for ESR1 mutations appears not to impair areal spine BMD.
Quaynor et al. (2013) studied an 18-year-old woman who presented at 15 years of age with absent breast development, primary amenorrhea, and intermittent lower abdominal pain. Examination revealed Tanner stage 1 breast development and Tanner stage 4 pubic hair, and she also had severe facial acne. She was found to have markedly elevated serum levels of estrogens, with a plasma estradiol level 10 times that of the normal value, and had a bone age of 11 to 12 years at a chronologic age of 15.5 years. Ultrasonography revealed a small uterus with no clearly identifiable endometrial stripe and markedly enlarged multicystic ovaries. Growth velocity indicated the lack of an estrogen-induced growth spurt at the time of puberty. At the age of 17.75 years, plain x-rays of her left hand showed a bone age of 13.5 years and open radial and ulnar epiphyses. MRI of the brain and pituitary was normal. She had no breast development after 5 months of receiving oral estrogen, and her normal serum levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding globulin, prolactin and triglycerides, all of which are known to be increased by estrogen, provided further evidence of estrogen resistance. Unlike the male patient with estrogen resistance reported by Smith et al. (1994), who had hyperinsulinemia, she had normal levels of fasting glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin, and a normal HOMA-IR, indicating no impaired glucose tolerance.
Bernard et al. (2017) reported 3 sibs from a consanguineous Algerian family with estrogen resistance. The proband was a 25-year-old 46,XX woman who presented with primary amenorrhea and absent breast development; pelvic ultrasonography showed bilateral enlarged multicystic ovaries and small uterus with thin endometrium. She had an extremely high 17-beta-estradiol level as well as elevated gonadotropins. Her 21-year-old 46,XX sister also showed no breast development and had primary amenorrhea. In addition, their 18-year-old 46,XY brother had Tanner stage I gonadal development, with a cryptorchid right testis and left testis volume of less than 1 cm. All 3 patients exhibited markedly delayed bone maturation. Their first-cousin parents had normal pubertal development at 15 years of age, and an unaffected sister had normal puberty with menarche at age 14 years.
**{Migraine, susceptibility to}, 157300 (3), AD**
Migraine is the most common type of chronic, episodic headache, as summarized by Featherstone (1985).
One locus for migraine with or without aura (MGR1) has been identified on chromosome 4q24. Other loci for migraine have been identified on 6p21.1-p12.2 (MGR3; 607498), 14q21.2-q22.3 (MGR4; 607501), 19p13 (MGR5; 607508), 1q31 (MGR6; 607516), 15q11-q13 (MGR7; 609179), 5q21 (with or without aura, MGR8, 609570; with aura, MGR9, 609670), 17p13 (MGR10; 610208), 18q12 (MGR11; 610209), 10q22-q23 (MGR12; 611706), and the X chromosome (MGR2; 300125).
Mutation in the KCNK18 gene (613655) on chromosome 10q25 causes migraine with aura (MGR13; 613656).
A subtype of autosomal dominant migraine with aura (MA), familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM; see 141500), is caused by mutation in the CACNA1A gene (601011) on chromosome 19p13 (FHM1; 141500), by mutation in the ATP1A2 gene (182340) on chromosome 1q21 (FHM2; 602481), or by mutation in the SCN1A gene (182389) on chromosome 2q24 (FHM3; 609634). Another locus for FHM has been mapped to chromosome 1q31 (FHM4; see 607516).
There is evidence that a polymorphism in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1; 133430.0005) and a polymorphism in the TNF gene (191160.0004) may confer susceptibility to migraine. A polymorphism in the endothelin receptor type A gene (EDNRA; 131243.0001) may confer resistance to migraine.
Most cases of migraine are of the mild rather than the classic type, which has prodromal neurologic deficit and severe, focal head pain. Since no biochemical marker for migraine has been found, migraine and its variants remain a clinical diagnosis (Featherstone, 1985). Refsum (1968), Raskin (1988), and Miller (1991) provided extensive reviews of all aspects of migraine.
In a study of 532 persons with migraine, Stewart et al. (2006) found that the relative risk (RR) of migraine in first-degree relatives was significantly increased (RR of 1.88) compared to controls. The RR of migraine was even higher for relatives of probands with onset before age 16 years (RR of 2.50) and with more severe pain (RR of 2.38). The results suggested higher levels of familial aggregation of migraines in those with earlier onset and more severe pain scores.
In a population-based case-control study of 140 Icelandic children with seizures and 180 controls, Ludvigsson et al. (2006) found that migraine with aura conferred an odds ratio of 8.1 for subsequent development of unprovoked seizures (see, e.g., idiopathic generalized epilepsy, EIG; 600669). Migraine without aura did not increase the risk for seizures. The prevalence of both types of migraine was 20.2% in children with seizures and 6.9% in controls. The findings were consistent with the hypothesis that migraine with aura and migraine without aura are separate disease entities, and suggested that migraine with aura and seizures may share a common pathogenesis.

**Microphthalmia, syndromic 12, 615524 (3), AR, AD**
Chitayat et al. (2007) described 3 deceased sibs, born to nonconsanguineous parents of French Canadian and English descent, with bilateral microphthalmia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and diaphragmatic hernia, who also exhibited mild facial dysmorphism with broad nasal root and tip and micrognathia. The female infant also had a small bicornuate uterus and cleft palate, and 1 of the male sibs had unfixed malrotated bowel. An earlier pregnancy had resulted in death due to presumed tangled cord, but was strongly suspected to represent the same syndrome. Chitayat et al. (2007) also reported an unrelated living child, a 9.5-year-old boy born to nonconsanguineous French parents, who had bilateral severe microphthalmia and underwent repair of a left diaphragmatic hernia at 2 months of age; lung CT scan did not show pulmonary hypoplasia, and pulmonary function tests at 19 months of age showed normal lung capacity. Dysmorphic features included sparse hair, brachycephaly, deep-set orbits, short palpebral fissures, and flat nasal bridge. He had severe language delay and was wheelchair-bound due to truncal hypotonia with spastic tetraparesis.

**Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 3, 616900 (3), AR**
Infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies-3 is a severe autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with onset at birth or in early infancy. Most affected individuals show very poor, if any, normal psychomotor development, poor speech, and inability to walk independently (summary by Bhoj et al., 2016).
For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies, see IHPRF1 (615419).
Chong et al. (2016) reported 5 children from 4 unrelated families with profound developmental disability with little progression beyond infancy, and severe hypotonia resulting in respiratory insufficiency and feeding tube placement. The patients ranged from 2 to 14 years in age. Two patients were from a consanguineous Lebanese family, 1 was from a consanguineous Egyptian family and had a similarly affected deceased sib, and 2 were unrelated and of Puerto Rican descent. Common dysmorphic facial features included bitemporal narrowing, arched eyebrows, deep-set eyes, high nasal bridge with anteverted nares, and Cupid bow. Three patients had coarse facial features, 2 had macroglossia, and 2 had gingival hyperplasia. Other features included decreased or absent reflexes, seizures, and cortical visual impairment. Brain imaging showed ventriculomegaly and cerebral atrophy, decreased cortical gray and white matter volume, thinning of the corpus callosum, small basal ganglia, cerebellar hypoplasia, and periventricular white matter abnormalities. Two first cousins had evidence of an axonal neuropathy and 2 additional patients had decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes in muscle.
Bhoj et al. (2016) reported 13 patients from 9 unrelated families with IHPRF. The patients ranged from 2 to 12 years in age; 2 sibs had previously been reported by Alazami et al. (2015). The patients presented at birth with severe hypotonia, mostly with reduced reflexes, and severely delayed psychomotor development; most did not achieve independent walking and had delayed speech acquisition. Three had respiratory insufficiency and 5 had seizures. Most had variable dysmorphic facial features, such as sloped forehead, macrocephaly, bulbous nose, tented upper lip, and coarse features with macroglossia. Brain imaging in most patients showed diffuse brain atrophy, enlarged ventricles, thin corpus callosum, and periventricular white matter abnormalities. However, 2 unrelated patients were slightly less affected and had mild cognitive impairment with normal or only mildly abnormal brain imaging findings.



PCLO
**?Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, type 3, 608027 (3), AR**
Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an abnormally small cerebellum and brainstem. Clinical features vary, but usually include severe developmental delay, dysmorphic features, seizures, and early death (summary by Durmaz et al., 2009).
For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of PCH, see PCH1 (607596).
Rajab et al. (2003) described a unique form of PCH, which they called cerebellar atrophy with progressive microcephaly (CLAM), in 3 sibs of a consanguineous family from the Sultanate of Oman. All 3 patients had microcephaly and generalized hypotonia at birth and developed seizures within the first year of life. There was severe developmental delay. Craniofacial features included brachycephaly, prominent eyes, and low-set ears. One patient had thoracic scoliosis, contractures of the elbows and knees, and clubfoot. Neurologically, all had truncal hypotonia and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. One patient had optic atrophy. Imaging studies of the brain showed small brainstem, small cerebellar vermis, and atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebrum. Rajab et al. (2003) concluded that the disorder in this family most closely resembled PCH type 2 (see 277470), although there was no extrapyramidal involvement or dyskinesia. They distinguished the disorder from progressive encephalopathy with edema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic atrophy (260565) and from cerebellar ataxia with mental retardation, optic atrophy, and skin abnormalities (606937). Rajab et al. (2003) suggested that the disorder resembled that reported by Zelnik et al. (1996), in which 3 patients had severe pontocerebellar atrophy with progressive microcephaly, hypotonia, visual impairment, and delayed psychomotor development, without dyskinesias.
Durmaz et al. (2009) reported a 3-year-old Turkish girl, born of consanguineous parents, with PCH and progressive microcephaly. She had severe developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and dysmorphic features, including wide palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, hypoplastic nares, full cheeks, long philtrum, depressed nasal bridge, downturned corners of the mouth, high palate, and large low-set ears. Her limbs showed increased tone. MRI showed hypoplasia of the cerebellum, brainstem, and cerebrum, associated with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Visual evoked potentials revealed unilateral optic atrophy, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials indicated unilateral hearing impairment.



CLCNKB
**Bartter syndrome, type 3, 607364 (3), AR**
Bartter syndrome refers to a group of disorders that are unified by autosomal recessive transmission of impaired salt reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle with pronounced salt wasting, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. Clinical disease results from defective renal reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the Henle loop, where 30% of filtered salt is normally reabsorbed (Simon et al., 1997).
Patients with antenatal (or neonatal) forms of Bartter syndrome (e.g., BARTS1, 601678) typically present with premature birth associated with polyhydramnios and low birth weight and may develop life-threatening dehydration in the neonatal period. Patients with classic Bartter syndrome present later in life and may be sporadically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (summary by Simon et al., 1996 and Fremont and Chan, 2012).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Bartter Syndrome
Antenatal Bartter syndrome type 1 (601678) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the butmetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC2 (SLC12A1; 600839). Antenatal Bartter syndrome type 2 (241200) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel ROMK (KCNJ1; 600359). One form of neonatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness, Bartter syndrome type 4A (602522), is caused by mutation in the BSND gene (606412). Another form of neonatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness, Bartter syndrome type 4B (613090), is caused by simultaneous mutation in both the CLCNKA (602024) and CLCNKB (602023) genes.
Also see autosomal dominant hypocalcemia-1 with Bartter syndrome (601198), which is sometimes referred to as Bartter syndrome type 5 (Fremont and Chan, 2012), caused by mutation in the CASR gene (601199).
See Gitelman syndrome (GTLMN; 263800), which is often referred to as a mild variant of Bartter syndrome, caused by mutation in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter SLC12A3 (600968).
Bartter syndrome (Bartter et al., 1962) is an unusual form of secondary hyperaldosteronism in which hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells are associated with normal blood pressure and hypokalemic alkalosis in the absence of edema. The primary defect resides in active chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle. The features are short stature, hyperactive renin-angiotensin system, lack of effect of angiotensin on blood pressure, renal potassium wasting, increased renal prostaglandin production, and occasionally hypomagnesemia.
Arant et al. (1970) reported 2 brothers with features of Bartter syndrome but with severe azotemia at the onset and in one of them renal osteodystrophy. Renal biopsy showed only mild hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells and severe glomerulonephritis. Most of the patients have shown retardation of growth and mental development, but the patient of Tarm et al. (1973) represented an exception. Erkelens and Statius van Eps (1973) described a patient with erythrocytosis in addition to the Bartter syndrome. They interpreted this as evidence that both renin and erythropoietin are produced in the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Dillon et al. (1979) studied 10 affected children, 2 of whom were sibs. Severity varied widely. Ages varied from 3 months to 15 years; sex distribution was equal. Hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, rickets, and urine acidification defects were seen in some patients. Indomethacin effected remarkable clinical and biochemical improvement. Simopoulos (1979) observed a delayed growth spurt in Bartter syndrome resulting in attainment of normal stature. Two-thirds of the children have some degree of mental retardation.
The relation of the disorder reported by De Jong et al. (1980) to the Bartter syndrome was unclear. They studied an adult brother and sister with hyperaldosteronism and hyperkalemia who differed from cases of Bartter syndrome in the presence of hypertension. Response to indomethacin suggested excessive prostaglandin production which may have been primary. The sibs also showed tachycardia.
Ramos et al. (1980) demonstrated that the Bartter syndrome can be simulated by habitual vomiting, as in anorexia nervosa. Renal biopsy showed hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Hyperkalemic alkalosis, normotensive hyperreninism, hyperaldosteronism, increased levels of urinary and plasma prostaglandin E (PGE), and vascular hyporesponsivity to angiotensin II were features identical to those of idiopathic Bartter syndrome, but unlike that disorder the patient showed low urinary chloride and no increase in the fractional chloride clearance. Any process that leads to hypokalemia can result in the Bartter syndrome. Wolfsdorf and Senior (1980) reported pseudo-Bartter syndrome in 2 infants fed exclusively with soybean-based formula which as a result of a manufacturing error was severely deficient in chloride.
In studies of 3 sibs, a boy and 2 girls aged 17, 11, and 18 years, Stoff et al. (1980) found a defect in platelet aggregation. They suggested that this may be caused by an increase in plasma cAMP resulting from excessive prostaglandins. Increased renal synthesis of these long chain fatty acids is presumably responsible for many features of the syndrome: vascular insensitivity, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and obligatory renal sodium loss. O'Regan et al. (1979) had demonstrated that presumed obligatory heterozygotes (parents) have impairment of epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, thought to reflect an abnormality of prostaglandin metabolism. Furthermore, a circulating inhibitor of platelet aggregation, probably a prostaglandin, was found. The inhibition of platelet aggregation was aggravated by salt depletion (Stoff et al., 1980) although renal features improved. Baehler et al. (1980) reported a 43-year-old man with Bartter syndrome who had suffered from generalized weakness, muscle cramps, and chest pain since his teens, with aggravation of these symptoms in the previous 6 months. Family information was not provided.
Kurtz et al. (1981) described a family in which 5 of 9 sibs (aged 20 to 30 years) had bilateral nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, chronic chloride-resistant renal metabolic alkalosis, and hypokalemia due to renal wasting. Creatinine clearance was little reduced. Plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone excretion were abnormally high. Blood pressure was normal. No defect in the loop of Henle could be demonstrated. No further information and no definitive report was available (Sebastian, 1989). Ruvalcaba and Martinez (1992) described 3 sibs with a combination of isolated growth hormone deficiency and Bartter syndrome. The mother had short stature with growth hormone deficiency. Other members of the kindred had average stature. All the patients were normotensive. Treatment of the 2 youngest sibs with growth hormone in addition to potassium and magnesium resulted in greater than doubled growth velocity. Smilde et al. (1994) described a family in which 7 members had hypokalemic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism. Also, as a major symptom, they had chondrocalcinosis, a known complication of Bartter syndrome. The proband was a female who presented at age 39 with acute attacks of arthritis and was found to have chondrocalcinosis of several joints. The metabolic changes of Bartter syndrome were found 15 years later and a decreased serum magnesium was found at the age of 61. Magnesium therapy was instituted at that time and over a period of 10 years a significant reduction of the calcifications was noted. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals were demonstrated in synovial fluid of the knee by polarized microscopy. In addition, 3 brothers out of a total of 9 sibs were also affected, as were a daughter and 2 sons of the proband. Symptomatic involvement of the symphysis pubis by the chondrocalcinosis was a feature in this family. The pattern of inheritance is consistent with autosomal recessive transmission if the proband were married to a heterozygote; none of the 16 children of her 3 affected brothers was affected. In all of the patients, urinary magnesium excretion was inappropriately high and urinary calcium excretion inappropriately low. Chondrocalcinosis by itself is usually an autosomal dominant (118600); combined potassium and magnesium wasting (263800) is an autosomal recessive disorder.
Simon et al. (1997) reported 17 kindreds with Bartter syndrome type 3, confirmed by genetic analysis. A review of index cases from each kindred showed that all had spontaneous hypokalemia (serum K+ levels as low as 1.1), all had elevation of serum bicarbonate, and all had evidence of salt-wasting. Age at presentation ranged from birth to 16 years. Six studied patients had elevation of serum renin and aldosterone. The fractional reabsorption of chloride in the TAL is normally 80 to 95%; in the index patients from 2 families, the fractional chloride reabsorption was profoundly depressed at 24% and 25%, respectively, indicating a striking defect in chloride reabsorption in the TAL. Hypercalciuria was present in 11 of 17 index cases, while 6 had calcium values in the normal range. The clinical picture in the cases described by Simon et al. (1997) varied in severity from near-fatal volume depletion with hypokalemic alkalosis and respiratory arrest or requirement for massive intravenous potassium replacement to very mild disease presenting with only polyuria and weakness at age 16. Even among patients with homozygous deletions, age at presentation and clinical severity were highly variable. A feature that distinguished the disorder clearly from other forms of Bartter syndrome was the absence of renal calcification (nephrocalcinosis) in all examined patients.
Fukuyama et al. (2004) reported 2 Japanese patients who suffered from clinically diagnosed classic Bartter syndrome but who had hypocalciuria. Hypocalciuria is believed to be a pathognomic finding of Na-Cl cotransporter malfunction. Two mutations in the CLCNKB gene were found (602023.0009, 602023.0010). The authors concluded that some CLCNKB mutations may affect calcium handling in renal tubular cells.
Sun et al. (2005) reported a patient with classic Bartter syndrome who had bilateral sclerochoroidal calcification. Optical coherence tomography showed normal retina and retinal pigment epithelium overlying the choroidal lesions. The patient had persistent hypomagnesemia and normocalcemia for 26 years despite magnesium supplementary treatment. The authors suggested that hypomagnesemia may have a pathogenic role in the development of sclerochoroidal calcification in this disorder.
**Bartter syndrome, type 4b, digenic, 613090 (3), Digenic recessive**
Bartter syndrome refers to a group of disorders that are unified by autosomal recessive transmission of impaired salt reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle with pronounced salt wasting, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. Clinical disease results from defective renal reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the Henle loop, where 30% of filtered salt is normally reabsorbed (Simon et al., 1997).
Patients with antenatal (or neonatal) forms of Bartter syndrome (e.g., BARTS1, 601678) typically present with premature birth associated with polyhydramnios and low birth weight and may develop life-threatening dehydration in the neonatal period. Patients with classic Bartter syndrome present later in life and may be sporadically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (summary by Simon et al., 1996 and Fremont and Chan, 2012).

FRAS1
**Fraser syndrome 1, 219000 (3), AR**
Fraser syndrome is an autosomal recessive malformation disorder characterized by cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, and abnormalities of the respiratory and urogenital tract (summary by van Haelst et al., 2008).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Fraser Syndrome
Fraser syndrome-2 (FRASRS2) is caused by mutation in the FREM2 gene (608945) on chromosome 13q13, and Fraser syndrome-3 (FRASRS3; 617667) is caused by mutation in the GRIP1 gene (604597) on chromosome 12q14.
See Bowen syndrome (211200) for a comparable but probably distinct syndrome of multiple congenital malformations.
In each of 2 sibships, Fraser (1962) observed 2 sisters affected at birth by various combinations: cryptophthalmos; absent or malformed lacrimal ducts; middle and outer ear malformations; high palate; cleavage along the midplane of nares and tongue; hypertelorism; laryngeal stenosis; syndactyly; wide separation of symphysis pubis; displacement of umbilicus and nipples; primitive mesentery of small bowel; maldeveloped kidneys; fusion of labia and enlargement of clitoris; and bicornuate uterus and malformed fallopian tubes. In each sibship, 1 sister was stillborn and the other viable. Sex chromatin was positive in both surviving infants. Neither set of parents was consanguineous.
Gupta and Saxena (1962) reported cryptophthalmos in 2 offspring of consanguineous parents. In 1 case it was unilateral and death occurred at 1 month. In the other the cryptophthalmos was bilateral and was accompanied by congenital deafness, undescended testes, small penis with hypospadias, and other deformities. The older literature on cryptophthalmos with associated malformations was reviewed by Duke-Elder (1963).
Francois (1969) described affected brother and sister and gave a comprehensive review, pointing out the rather frequent examples of parental consanguinity (about 15% of cases) and of familial cases. Syndactyly is a feature of many of the cases. Francannet et al. (1990) reported instances of parental consanguinity: in 1 family, 3 children were born of a first-cousin marriage, and in a second, an affected fetus resulted from a double first-cousin marriage. An isolated case was reported by Ide and Wollschlaeger (1969). The parents were not related. The patient had syndactyly, hair extending forward over the temples, deformity of the nares and external auditory meatus, etc. Azevedo et al. (1973) reported 4 cases in 2 sibships, each with consanguineous parents. Syndactyly and other malformations were present in some.
Lurie and Cherstvoy (1984) reported 4 families with the cryptophthalmos-syndactyly syndrome. Perinatal death occurred in 9 affected members. Autopsy, performed in 6 cases, showed renal agenesis (bilateral in 3, unilateral in 3). One family had at least 4 affected sibs and 2 others had 2 affected children each. No consanguinity was established.
Burn and Marwood (1982) reported 3 sibs with Fraser syndrome presenting as bilateral renal agenesis. Only 1 of the 3 sibs had cryptophthalmos (which was unilateral). Because cryptophthalmos is not an essential part of the syndrome, Fraser syndrome is a preferable designation.
Mortimer et al. (1985) reported monozygotic twins concordant for bilateral renal agenesis and other features consistent with Fraser syndrome: syndactyly and laryngeal stenosis.
From their personal experience and a review of the literature, Koenig and Spranger (1986) identified 5 cases of the cryptophthalmos-syndactyly syndrome without cryptophthalmos. Thomas et al. (1986) also emphasized the occurrence of the cryptophthalmos syndrome without cryptophthalmos--an argument for using the eponym Fraser syndrome. In a literature review, they found 124 cases of cryptophthalmos of which 27 were isolated and 97 associated with multiple malformations. They found that isolated cryptophthalmos was sporadic in 16 cases and familial in 11. The familial cases were in 3 families with vertical transmission (123570). Some of the most characteristic malformations of the Fraser syndrome occur in areas that remain temporarily fused in utero: the eyelids, the digits, and the vagina. Since separation of the eyelids and digits involves a process of controlled necrosis, Thomas et al. (1986) speculated about a defect in programmed cell death. They also drew attention to the parallel with experimental teratogenesis by means of hypovitaminosis A in the pig and rat. Malformations reminiscent of the Fraser syndrome are produced. Thomas et al. (1986) asked whether defects in the metabolism of retinoids may play a role in pathogenesis. Meinecke (1986) also contributed to the understanding of the Fraser syndrome without cryptophthalmos.
Greenberg et al. (1986) described associated gonadal dysgenesis in an infant girl with Fraser syndrome: gonadoblastoma developed in a dysgenetic ovary.
Gattuso et al. (1987) gave a quantitative estimate of the frequency of the several clinical manifestations of Fraser syndrome on the basis of 3 new cases and 68 published cases. Craniofacial abnormalities were reported in all, cryptophthalmos in 93%, and syndactyly in 54%.
Bialer and Wilson (1988) reported a child who according to the strict criteria proposed by Thomas et al. (1986) might not be considered to have syndromal cryptophthalmos; however, the child had several malformations considered minor in that classification and was born of parents who were related in a complex way, giving the proband a coefficient of consanguinity of 0.086.
Boyd et al. (1988) presented postmortem findings in 11 cases of probable Fraser syndrome; 8 were neonatal deaths, 1 was a stillbirth, and 2 were midtrimester fetuses. Ramsing et al. (1990) presented the clinical and autopsy findings in 2 fetuses and 1 newborn infant with Fraser syndrome.
Stevens et al. (1994) observed pulmonary hyperplasia and laryngeal stenosis in 2 sibs with Fraser cryptophthalmos syndrome. Markedly enlarged echogenic lungs were demonstrable at 16 and 17 weeks of gestation. A third unrelated patient with Fraser syndrome had laryngeal stenosis, renal agenesis, and normal lung development. Reports of 3 additional cases of pulmonary hyperplasia in the Fraser syndrome were found. In all of these cases the likely mechanism for pulmonary hyperplasia was retention of fetal lung fluid by laryngeal or tracheal obstruction.
Pankau et al. (1994) described a newborn female with total syndactyly of the 3rd and 4th fingers, partial syndactyly of all other fingers, postaxial polydactyly of feet, bilateral renal agenesis, and bilateral anophthalmia. The child was born of consanguineous Turkish parents. Although the infant had normal eyelids with palpebrae and eyelashes and had histologically confirmed anophthalmia and postaxial polydactyly, Pankau et al. (1994) considered this case to be an unusual manifestation of Fraser syndrome.
Amr (1996) described unilateral cryptophthalmos with bilateral renal agenesis and syndactyly of hands and feet in a stillborn female fetus.
Andiran et al. (1999) reported a case of Fraser syndrome with anterior urethral atresia. They suggested that newborns with Fraser syndrome, especially those with umbilical discharge or severe hydroureteronephrosis, be evaluated for patency of the anterior urethra.
Slavotinek and Tifft (2002) reviewed 117 cases diagnosed as Fraser syndrome or cryptophthalmos published after the comprehensive review of Thomas et al. (1986). Their findings emphasized the clinical variability associated with Fraser syndrome and supported heterogeneity of the disorder. They also noted patterns of anomalies (for example, bicornuate uterus with imperforate anus or anal stenosis and renal malformations) that are found in other syndromes and associations without cryptophthalmos, suggesting that common modifier genes may explain some of the phenotypic variation in Fraser syndrome.
Van Haelst et al. (2007) studied the clinical features of 59 newly diagnosed individuals with Fraser syndrome from 40 families, including 25 consanguineous families. Compared to previous reviews, they found a higher frequency of abnormalities of the skull, larynx, umbilicus, urinary tract, and anus, and a lower frequency of mental retardation and cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Clinical features in probands and sibs were remarkably similar. Prenatally diagnosed patients had more manifestations giving rise to a pathologic amount of amniotic fluid, but otherwise had similar frequency of symptoms to those diagnosed postnatally.



SBF2
**Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4B2, 604563 (3), AR**
Autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B is a demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by abnormal folding of myelin sheaths. CMT4B1 (601382) is a clinically similar disorder caused by mutation in the MTMR2 gene (603557) on 11q22.
For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of autosomal recessive demyelinating CMT, see CMT4A (214400).
Gambardella et al. (1998) reported 2 sibs in a family from a small village in southern Italy who had early-onset CMT with focally folded myelin sheaths. The patients developed symptoms at 2 and 10 years of age, respectively. Both had progressive distal lower limb weakness and atrophy, followed by involvement of the upper limbs. There was distal sensory loss, areflexia, and bilateral pes equinovarus. Both patients also had unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, suggesting cranial nerve involvement. Sural nerve biopsy showed segmental demyelination and redundant loops and folds of the myelin sheath. Gambardella et al. (1998) suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Linkage analysis excluded the CMT4B1 locus on chromosome 11q23.
Senderek et al. (2003) reported a consanguineous Turkish family in which 4 patients were affected with a severe sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by focally folded myelin sheaths on nerve biopsy. Disease onset was around age 5 years and was characterized by distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities such as pes cavus and hammertoes, steppage gait, and areflexia in the lower limbs. Motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) were severely reduced (e.g., 16.5 m/s, 18.5 m/s). Sural nerve biopsies showed severe loss of myelinated fibers with focally folded myelin protrusions.
CMT4B2 With Early-Onset Glaucoma
Kiwaki et al. (2000) reported a consanguineous family from southern Japan in which 3 members had hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with myelin folding accompanied by juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma. All 3 patients had early childhood onset of neuropathy, markedly slowed NCVs of less than 20 m/s, aberrantly excessive myelin folding complexes with segmental de- and remyelination on nerve biopsy, increased CSF protein, and juvenile-onset glaucoma.
Azzedine et al. (2003) reported 2 consanguineous families from Tunisia and Morocco with a demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy and early-onset glaucoma. Mean age at onset was 8 years. Motor nerve conduction velocities were severely reduced, and nerve biopsies showed myelin outfoldings. In the index patient of each family, visual impairment was precocious and severe, leading to a loss of vision. Ophthalmologic examination showed congenital glaucoma with a buphthalmos, a megalocornea, and increased intraocular pressure. Other affected members of both families had increased intraocular pressure.



OCLN
**Pseudo-TORCH syndrome 1, 251290 (3), AR**
Pseudo-TORCH syndrome-1 is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder with characteristic clinical and neuroradiologic features that mimic intrauterine TORCH infection in the absence of evidence of infection. Affected individuals have congenital microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, simplified gyration and polymicrogyria, and severe developmental delay (Reardon et al., 1994; O'Driscoll et al., 2010).
Crow et al. (2000, 2003) called attention to the phenotypic overlap of pseudo-TORCH syndrome and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS; 225750), and even suggested that some cases may represent the same disorder. Congenital microcephaly, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, and hepatosplenomegaly are usually associated with pseudo-TORCH syndrome and not with AGS, but some patients with AGS have shown these features.
Genetic Heterogeneity of Pseudo-TORCH Syndrome
See also PTORCH2 (617397), caused by mutation in the USP18 gene (607057) on chromosome 22q11, and PTORCH3 (618886), caused by mutation in the STAT2 gene (600556) on chromosome 12q13.
Ishitsu et al. (1985) described 2 brothers, aged 49 and 17 months, with microcephaly, severe mental retardation, quadriplegia, and calcification of the cerebral white matter. Congenital toxoplasmosis was excluded by the negative serology in the mother and sons, by the absence of chorioretinopathy, and by the different character of the cerebral calcification. They suggested that this was a previously undescribed genetic disorder, either autosomal or X-linked recessive. The parents were not related.
Baraitser et al. (1983) reported 2 infant sibs born with congenital microcephaly who developed seizures, hypertonia, and spasticity. There was severe developmental delay, and imaging studies showed intracranial calcifications in the white matter and thalamus. There was no evidence of intrauterine infection. Postmortem examination was not performed.
Burn et al. (1986) reported 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish/Cypriot parents, with a disorder resembling intrauterine infection. Both patients were born with microcephaly, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and corneal clouding. Both were jittery in the first hours of life and were found to have thrombocytopenia and petechiae. Brain imaging showed intracranial periventricular calcification. There was no evidence of intrauterine infection. Both infants died at ages 30 and 50 days, respectively. Postmortem examination showed enlarged ventricles, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, and severely disorganized cortex. There was massive calcification throughout the brain. The basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala were shrunken and calcified with severe neuronal loss and gliosis. Calcification was also present in the cerebellum and brainstem. Burn et al. (1986) commented that the disorder in these sibs was distinct from Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.
Reardon et al. (1994) presented data on 10 patients from 5 families with a combination of microcephaly, intracranial calcification, and a clinical course resembling congenital TORCH infection. The parents were first cousins in 1 family. Hepatomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, petechial rash, and thrombocytopenia were present in some of the affected persons. The optic fundi were normal in all cases in which they were examined. Reardon et al. (1994) compared these cases with those reported by Baraitser et al. (1983), Ishitsu et al. (1985), and Burn et al. (1986). Based on their observations, Reardon et al. (1994) suggested that this entity can be characterized by microcephaly from birth, seizures, periventricular calcification, and sometimes hepatosplenomegaly, platelet dysfunction, and purpura which clinically mimics TORCH infection. The entity was considered to be distinct from the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.
Monastiri et al. (1997) reported 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital microcephaly, profound growth retardation, and periventricular calcifications. Variable features included thrombocytopenia, anemia, corneal clouding, spasticity, seizures, and hepatosplenomegaly. Both died in infancy. One sib had dysmorphic features, including microphthalmia, hypertelorism, micrognathia, and micropenis, and left ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The other sib had no dysmorphic features.
Slee et al. (1999) presented 2 sisters with congenital microcephaly, developmental delay, marked microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, cerebral and cerebellar hypoplasia, and extensive intracranial periventricular calcification. No evidence of intrauterine infection was found. Slee et al. (1999) suggested that the sibs they reported represented a more severe form of pseudo-TORCH syndrome or a previously undescribed entity. Microcephaly with chorioretinopathy (251270) has changes reminiscent of those seen with fetal intrauterine infection, particularly toxoplasmosis; hence, the designation pseudotoxoplasmosis syndrome.
Briggs et al. (2008) reported 5 patients, including 2 sib pairs, with a distinct pattern of band-like intracranial calcifications, profound developmental delay, postnatal microcephaly, and simplified gyration or polymicrogyria. Two sibs were born of consanguineous Turkish parents. The disorder resembled pseudo-TORCH syndrome, except that none of the patients had thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, or congenital microcephaly. Other features included seizures and spastic quadriparesis with hypotonia. Calcification was present in the basal ganglia, thalami, and pons, and formed a ribbon in the posterior frontal, perisylvian, anterior temporal and anterior parietal areas. Some patients had a slightly hypoplastic cerebellum. Mutation in known AGS genes was excluded in 1 patient. In addition, the 2 Turkish sibs had possible evidence of early postnatal cytomegalovirus infection. Although the same group (Crow et al. (2000, 2003)) had previously suggested that some cases of pseudo-TORCH syndrome may represent Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, Briggs et al. (2008) noted that the umbrella term 'pseudo-TORCH syndrome' remains a useful designation in cases in which the disorder is clearly not Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, as in their report.
Abdel-Salam et al. (2008) reported a consanguineous family from Egypt in which 5 sibs had congenital microcephaly, growth retardation, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. There were multiple structural brain anomalies, including cortical band-like calcification, calcifications of the basal ganglia and brainstem, polymicrogyria, loss of white matter, dysplastic ventricles, and hypogenesis of the corpus callosum and cerebellum. Some of the patients had dysmorphic facial features, such as anteverted nostrils, high-arched palate, low-set ears, and sloping forehead. Other features included nystagmus and spasticity. Three died within the first years of life, whereas 2 died within days after birth with high fever and status epilepticus. No abnormalities of the eyes were noted. The features overlapped those of pseudo-TORCH syndrome.
Abdel-Salam and Zaki (2009) presented a family in which 2 sibs had congenital microcephaly, refractory seizures, apneic spells, sterile pyrexia, intracranial calcifications, polymicrogyria, dysplastic ventricles, hypogenesis of the corpus callosum, and loss of white matter. Facial features included sloping forehead, bitemporal grooving, nystagmus, prominent anteverted nostrils, long philtrum, high-arched palate, and microretrognathia. There was truncal hypotonia, absent head control, and increased tone of arms and legs with hyperreflexia. The patients died at 15 and 16 months of age, respectively. The authors concluded that the phenotype was consistent with an autosomal recessive form of a congenital infection-like syndrome.
O'Driscoll et al. (2010) described 10 affected individuals from 6 families with BLCPMG. Three of the families had been previously reported by Briggs et al. (2008) and Abdel-Salam and Zaki (2009). All affected individuals were severely microcephalic, developed seizures within 4 months of birth, showed demonstrated minimal developmental progress, and had spastic tetraparesis. Four of 5 patients had increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels. Brain imaging showed bilateral symmetrical PMG in a perisylvian and temporal distribution, with severe loss of cerebral volume, simplified gyration, and wide sylvian fissures. Calcification was present bilaterally in the deep cortical gray matter with variable calcification in the pons, thalami, and globus pallidus. Postmortem analysis of 1 patient showed mineral deposits in the deep cerebral and cerebellar cortices, frequently surrounding small blood vessels. Calcification was noted in cells in close apposition to endothelia, which possibly represented pericytes or astrocytes. Blood vessels without associated calcification were also seen.
Clinical Variability
LeBlanc et al. (2013) reported 2 patients from a consanguineous Maritime Canadian family who had a complex phenotype comprising congenital microcephaly, intracranial primarily subcortical calcifications in the thalami, basal ganglia, and subcortical white matter, severely delayed psychomotor development, cortical visual impairment, early-onset seizures, and chronic renal dysfunction with small echogenic kidneys, consistent with cortical calcifications. One of the patients had no evidence of a neuronal migration defect, but the other had evidence of mild polymicrogyria. The patients had no independent motility, use of the hands, or speech. An extensive genetic workup, including homozygosity mapping, candidate gene sequencing, exome sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, PCR analysis, and Sanger sequencing identified a homozygous genomic rearrangement involving the OCLN gene. The rearrangement was a deletion within exon 9, which is expressed in all 7 of the known OCLN isoforms. Genetic analysis was complicated by the presence of a pseudogene in this region; the patients were homozygous for the pseudogene, whereas normal controls were heterozygous for the OCLN gene and the pseudogene. Although some of the patients reported by O'Driscoll et al. (2010) had less severe renal impairment, LeBlanc et al. (2013) noted that extracranial phenotypes, particularly the severe renal impairment seen in their patients, have not consistently been reported in this disorder. Previously reported OCLN mutations have occurred in exons 3 to 6 or at the 5-6 intron splice site, and are thus not expressed in all isoforms. LeBlanc et al. (2013) suggested that the loss of peripheral OCLN in their patients with interruption of exon 9 may explain the unusual renal involvement.



RPIA
**?Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase deficiency, 608611 (3), AR**
Van der Knaap et al. (1999) reported a 14-year-old boy, born of unrelated parents, with leukoencephalopathy associated with a disturbance in the metabolism of polyols. The boy had psychomotor retardation from early in life and developed epilepsy at age 4 years. From age 7 years, a slow neurologic regression occurred with prominent cerebellar ataxia, some spasticity, optic atrophy, and a mild sensorimotor neuropathy. Neither organomegaly nor dysfunction of the internal organs was present. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were mildly decreased in his arms and legs, confirming a polyneuropathy. Extensive abnormalities of the cerebral white matter were demonstrated by MRI of the brain at age 14 years. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain showed highly elevated abnormal peaks that were identified as representing pentitols ribitol and arabitol. Huck et al. (2004) demonstrated deficient activity of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase, one of the pentose phosphate pathway enzymes, in fibroblasts from the patient reported by van der Knaap et al. (1999). They noted that deficiency of transaldolase (602063), another enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, had previously been demonstrated in a patient with liver cirrhosis and abnormal polyol levels in body fluids. RPI deficiency represented the second instance of an inborn error in the reversible phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, confirming that defects in pentose and polyol metabolism constitute a group of inborn metabolic disorders.
Mahler et al. (2019) reported a child with severe global developmental delay, tapetoretinal degeneration, and coordination difficulties who was found to have a mutation in the RPIA gene.



BMPR1B
**Acromesomelic dysplasia, Demirhan type, 609441 (3), AR**
Demirhan et al. (2005) reported a 16-year-old girl from a multiconsanguineous family who had a severe limb malformation consisting of severe brachydactyly with radial deviation of the fingers, ulnar deviation of the hands, fusion of the carpal/tarsal bones, aplasia of the fibula, and bilateral clubfoot deformity with small broad feet and short toes that appeared constricted at their bases. In addition, she had genital anomalies and primary amenorrhea; ultrasound examination revealed absence of the ovaries and hypoplasia of the uterus, and endocrinologic studies confirmed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.
Graul-Neumann et al. (2014) described 2 consanguineous families in which 3 individuals (1 female and 2 males) had a severe form of limb malformation consisting of bilateral aplasia of the fibula, severe brachydactyly, and carpal/tarsal fusion. One affected individual also had bowing of tibiae and radii. The mother in the first family had mild type A2 brachydactyly (BDA2; 112600) with shortened middle phalanges of the second and fifth fingers and toes. Both parents in the second family were short of stature; the father also had mild generalized brachydactyly. Graul-Neumann et al. (2014) diagnosed the patients with Grebe-type acromesomelic dysplasia (AMDG; 200700).
Stange et al. (2015) described an individual with disproportionate short stature, mild acromesomelic dysplasia, limb shortening, absent fibulae, short fingers, abnormal finger joints with deviations, and hypoplastic toes with broad and short toenails. Abdominal ultrasound was normal, with the presence of a uterus and ovaries of normal size and shape. There was no hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and the patient had normal levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, and progesterone. Stange et al. (2015) diagnosed the patient with du Pan acromesomelic dysplasia (228900).
**Brachydactyly, type A1, D, 616849 (3), AD**
Racacho et al. (2015) reported 2 unrelated patients with 'BDA1-like' brachydactyly. The first proband, a 16-month-old Caucasian girl born to healthy unrelated parents, was of normal stature but had very short index fingers and ulnar curvature of the fifth digits, with reduced digital creases at the distal interphalangeal joints. She also had shortened big toes and very long second toes, with moderate syndactyly between toes 2 and 3. Hand x-rays showed absence of the middle phalanges of the index fingers, with very small middle phalanges of the fifth digits, as well as slightly reduced size of the terminal phalanges of the thumbs. The metacarpophalangeal pattern profile (MCPP) revealed short proximal and distal phalanges of both thumbs, severe shortening of the middle phalanx of digit 2, shortening of the middle and distal phalanges of digit 3, and slight shortening of the middle phalanx of digit 5. The bones of digit 4 appeared to be normal. The second proband, a 9-year-old boy of African descent who was born to healthy unrelated parents, presented at 11 months of age with brachydactyly and clinodactyly of both fifth digits and the right thumb. Hand x-rays showed a small cube-shaped middle phalanx of digit 2, with a socket-like groove for the epiphysis of the proximal phalanx, as well as a small trapezoid-shaped middle phalanx of digit 5 in both hands. MCPP from both hands revealed a shortened proximal phalanx of digit 1, moderate shortening of the distal phalanges of digits 1 and 2, and severe shortening of the middle phalanges of digits 2 and 5. The feet of this patient were not described. Noting the disproportionate lengthening of digits 3 and 4 in the hands, Racacho et al. (2015) designated his condition as mixed BDA1-arachnodactyly.
**Brachydactyly, type A2, 112600 (3), AD**
Brachydactyly type A2 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by malformations of the middle phalanx of the index finger and by anomalies of the second toe (summary by Su et al., 2011).
In brachydactyly type A2, shortening of the middle phalanges is confined to the index finger and the second toe, all other digits being more or less normal. Because of a rhomboid or triangular shape of the affected middle phalanx, the end of the second finger usually deviates radially. Temtamy and McKusick (1978) noted that this rare form of brachydactyly had been described in 3 different kindreds of German, Norwegian, and Swiss descent (Ziegner, 1903; Mohr and Wriedt, 1919; Hanhart, 1940). The family of Mohr and Wriedt (1919) contained a possible homozygote. Temtamy and McKusick (1978) provided details of a fourth affected family, of African American descent, originally reported by Edelson (1972).
Seemann et al. (2005) described a large Norwegian pedigree with short index fingers and variable clinodactyly. X-rays showed hypoplasia or aplasia of the second phalanx of the second digit and, to a variable extent, shortening and shape abnormalities of the middle phalanx of the fifth digit.
Kjaer et al. (2006) studied 37 living members of the then 9-generation Norwegian family of Danish descent with BDA2 originally described by Mohr and Wriedt (1919), including 2 individuals who had been examined by Mohr and Wriedt when they were children. Nineteen family members had a shortened or absent middle phalanx of the index finger, and other fingers were occasionally involved. The fourth finger was characteristically spared, leading the authors to suggest that the phenotype in this family represented a subtype of brachydactyly type A2.
Ploger et al. (2008) studied 14 affected and 14 unaffected members of a 6-generation family with BDA2. All 5 affected individuals who were radiologically evaluated had a metacarpophalangeal profile that demonstrated a second mesophalanx that was shorter than mesophalanges 3, 4, and 5, consistent with a diagnosis of BDA2. Other occasional findings included a relatively short first metacarpal or first proximal phalanx. Hands were more commonly affected than feet. The phenotype was variable, with some affected individuals showing an almost normal pattern, whereas others had additional features such as mild hypoplasia of middle phalanges of fingers 3 and 4, indicating overlap with BDA1 (112500) and BDC (113100).



DCDC2
**?Deafness, autosomal recessive 66, 610212 (3), AR**
Tlili et al. (2005) described a 6-generation consanguineous Tunisian family of 54 individuals of which 10 were affected by a profound congenital nonsyndromic deafness. Audiometric tests showed loss of hearing greater than 70 dB for all frequencies tested in all affected individuals. All deaf individuals were otherwise healthy, with normal life spans and without dysmorphic or other abnormal findings, including vestibular defects, skeletal or craniofacial malformations, subcutaneous calcifications, or neural tube defects.
**Nephronophthisis 19, 616217 (3), AR**
Schueler et al. (2015) reported a boy, born of consanguineous parents, who developed hepatic fibrosis at age 11 months and end-stage renal disease due to nephronophthisis at age 14 years. Renal evaluation showed increased echogenicity, severe interstitial fibrosis, and tubular dilation with prominent epithelial luminal budding. The patient had hepatosplenomegaly with extensive fibrosis, destruction of the bile ducts, focal bile ductal proliferation, and cholestasis. He died at 16 years of age from esophageal bleeding. An unrelated patient had hepatosplenomegaly, ductal plate malformation, hepatic fibrosis, and mild cholestasis; he underwent liver transplantation at age 2 years, and had no renal involvement at age 9 years.
**Sclerosing cholangitis, neonatal, 617394 (3), AR**
Neonatal sclerosing cholangitis is a rare autosomal recessive form of severe liver disease with onset in infancy. Affected infants have jaundice, cholestasis, acholic stools, and progressive liver dysfunction resulting in fibrosis and cirrhosis; most require liver transplantation in the first few decades of life. Cholangiography shows patent biliary ducts, but there are bile duct irregularities (summary by Girard et al., 2016; Grammatikopoulos et al., 2016).
Girard et al. (2016) reported 4 patients from 2 unrelated consanguineous families with neonatal sclerosing cholangitis. The patients presented with neonatal icterus, cholestasis, acholic stools, and portal hypertension. All were diagnosed with cirrhosis between 2 and 9 months of age. In family 1, the sibs needed liver transplantation at ages 25 and 14 years, respectively, whereas in family 2, 1 sib needed liver transplantation at age 6 years, and the other was on the waiting list at age 3.5 years. Cholangiograms showed patent bile ducts with thin and irregular intrahepatic biliary tree; the patients in family 2 also had extrahepatic bile duct irregularities. Liver biopsy showed cirrhosis and fibrosis. The patients had variable renal involvement: 1 patient had left vesicoureteral reflux with ureteral duplication and a small left kidney, and showed altered renal function after liver transplant associated with septic shock, whereas his sib had normal renal morphology and size, but also developed altered renal function after transplant. In the other family, 1 sib had a hyperechogenic kidney with normal renal function. One of the 4 patients had mild developmental delay; otherwise, none of the patients had additional features, including skin involvement or hearing loss.
Grammatikopoulos et al. (2016) reported 7 patients from 6 unrelated families, 4 of whom were of Greek descent, with neonatal sclerosing cholangitis. The patients presented in the first weeks or years of life (median age of 6 weeks) with jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pale stools, and/or abnormal liver function tests with increased serum GGT (see 612346). Cholangiography confirmed intrahepatic cholangiopathy in all patients. Liver biopsies showed ductular proliferation, portal tract inflammation, and bridging fibrosis, and most patients developed biliary cirrhosis. Other histologic findings included ductal bile plugs, variable ectasia of perihilar bile ducts, absence of bile ducts in areas of fibrosis, and chronic cholestasis. Five patients underwent liver transplantation between 10 and 15 years of age, 1 patient was lost to follow-up at age 6 years, and another died at age 16 years without liver transplantation. Two patients had renal involvement: the patient who died at age 16 without a liver transplant developed end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis before she died, and another patient developed hepatorenal syndrome that resolved after liver transplantation. None of the patients had neurologic involvement or hearing loss.



SMOC2
**Dentin dysplasia, type I, with microdontia and misshapen teeth, 125400 (3), AR**
In dentin dysplasia type I, both primary and secondary dentitions are affected. The color and general morphology of the teeth are usually normal, although they may be slightly opalescent and blue or brown. Teeth may be very mobile and exfoliate spontaneously because of inadequate root formation. On radiographs, the roots are short and may be more pointed than normal. Pulp chambers are usually absent except for a chevron-shaped remnant in the crown (Witkop, 1975). Root canals are usually absent. Periapical radiolucencies may be present at the apices of affected teeth, for reasons unknown. On light microscopic examination of the permanent teeth, the coronal dentin is normal, but further apically becomes irregular, fills the pulp chamber, and has a 'sand-dune' morphology. Scanning electron microscopic studies of the deciduous and permanent teeth have been reported (Sauk et al., 1972; Melnick et al., 1980).
Subclassification of Dentin Dysplasia Type I
O Carroll et al. (1991) and O Carroll and Duncan (1994) reviewed dentin dysplasia and proposed 4 subtypes of dentin dysplasia type I, which they designated as DD1a-d. In DD1a, there is complete obliteration of pulp chambers and no root development, with many periapical radiolucent areas. In DD1b, there are horizontal crescent-shaped radiolucent pulpal remnants and a few millimeters of root development, with many periapical radiolucent areas. DD1c shows 2 horizontal crescent-shaped radiolucent lines and significant but incomplete root development, with or without periapical radiolucent areas. DD1d is characterized by visible pulp chambers and oval pulp stones in the coronal third of the root canal with bulging of the root around the stones and few if any periapical radiolucent areas. The authors noted that the distinctions between the subtypes of DD1 were primarily useful clinically in terms of treatment options.
Brown (1944) described a 19-year-old boy with underdeveloped dental roots and early exfoliation of the teeth. The father and a paternal uncle were edentulous. Lind (1972) described hypoplasia of the teeth roots in 3 generations.
Morris and Augsburger (1977) reported a kindred in which dentin dysplasia type I was associated with generalized osteosclerosis and mild shortening of the distal ulna; see 125440.
O Carroll and Duncan (1994) studied a large 6-generation family in which 35 individuals were confirmed or reliably reported to have dentin dysplasia type I, and a further 6 were suspected of having it on the basis of the autosomal dominant nature of its transmission. Two affected family members had been reported by Duncan et al. (1991). The coronal size, shape, and color of most of the teeth were normal, but root size and shape were markedly altered. Panoramic radiographs revealed either complete pulpal obliteration or semilunar pulpal remnants, with no root structure present or roots that were either a few millimeters long or were 10 to 15 mm long. Some patients had only short roots and others exhibited a combination of both types. Periapical radiolucent lesions were found on almost all teeth in most affected individuals. Of 18 patients in whom panoramic radiographs were made, 8 were classified as having DD1a, the most severe form of dentin dysplasia, and the remaining 10 were classified as having DD1b.
Kalk et al. (1998) reported 5 affected individuals over 2 generations of a family with dentin dysplasia type I. The proband was an 8-year-old boy who was referred due to delayed eruption of upper central incisors. Examination revealed dentition with normal morphology and color, except for opacity of the incisional margin of the erupted incisors. All deciduous and permanent teeth were highly mobile. The dentition was free of caries, although oral hygiene was poor. Panoramic radiographs showed short, blunted, and malformed roots in both the deciduous and permanent teeth. The root canals were obliterated and appeared as small slits at the apices of the lower incisors; they were not visible in other teeth at all. The pulp chambers were obliterated as well, appearing as 2 crescent-shaped radiolucent lines, concave towards each other, in both deciduous and permanent molars. Periapical radiolucencies were present at the permanent lower incisors and first molars. The proband's father also had a history of delayed eruption, and stated that he had lost most of his teeth at an early age due to spontaneous exfoliation, requiring a full maxillary denture and partial mandibular denture by the end of adolescence. Panoramic radiographs showed obliterated root canals and pulp chambers, short roots, and periapical lucencies, confirming the diagnosis of DTDP1. The father had 2 sisters with the same history of delayed eruption and premature exfoliation, and 1 of the sisters had an affected 11-year-old daughter. Kalk et al. (1998) stated that the short root lengths in this family did not correlate with the radiographic pulp obliteration, and thus subclassification of patients into the previously proposed 4 distinct forms was not possible. In addition, root lengths varied from diminutive to intermediate, and cases could not be described as 'total' or 'subtotal.'
Dentin Dysplasia, Type I, With Extreme Microdontia and Misshapen Teeth
Bloch-Zupan et al. (2011) described a 10-year-old boy and his 5-year-old female first cousin, both born of consanguineous Turkish parents, who had extreme microdontia, oligodontia, dental shape anomalies, double permanent-tooth formation, thin enamel, and short roots with thin associated alveolar bone. Oligodontia was diagnosed due to missing permanent teeth, 14 in the boy and 13 in the girl. Anomalies of tooth size were observed, and extreme microdontia affected both the primary teeth, which were all present, and the permanent teeth; however, some of the permanent teeth were macrodontic. All existing teeth showed anomalies of shape, with extra cusps and tiny, globular, malformed crowns, especially in the primary dentition. Double tooth formation (notched and macrodontic) was visible on the permanent incisors. Temporary and permanent molars exhibited taurodontism; in addition, the molars had tooth-structure anomalies reminiscent of dentin dysplasia type I spectrum, with very short roots. Dental x-rays showed that the enamel was very thin and had limited contrast compared to the dentin. The alveolar bone associated with the primary teeth was underdeveloped, and the primary teeth were mobile and exfoliated prematurely. Psychomotor development was normal in both children; the girl was obese and had 'very mild bone abnormalities' that were not present in her male cousin. Bloch-Zupan et al. (2011) stated that the dental phenotype in the affected cousins resembled that of dentin dysplasia type I, but was distinct because of the extreme microdontia and dental shape anomalies.
AlFawaz et al. (2013) reported 3 sibs, aged 16, 10, and 8 years, from a consanguineous Pakistani family with oligodontia and microdontia. Some teeth also showed abnormal forms with buccal evagination, and there was an incisal notch in the central incisors of varying degrees. Radiographic examination revealed 10 to 15 missing adult teeth in each of the sibs, and there was evidence of taurodontism in some of their posterior permanent molars; the permanent molars also displayed a single root with a thistle-shaped pulp. Two of the sibs had an anterior open bite due to lack of upper anterior alveolar growth, and all 3 had increased amounts of calculus deposits in the lower central incisor region.



TRIM2
**Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2R, 615490 (3), AR**
Ylikallio et al. (2013) reported an 18-year-old Finnish girl with early-onset axonal peripheral neuropathy. She had mildly delayed motor development with independent walking at age 1 year. Examination at age 4 years showed generalized hypotonia, thin build with small muscle mass, atrophy of the small muscles in the hands and feet, and areflexia. She walked with a broad-based gait and could not walk on her heels. Electrophysiologic studies showed polyneuropathy of the upper and lower limbs, with decreased motor nerve conduction velocities and decreased sensory and motor amplitudes. She also had pes cavus. Sural nerve biopsy showed a decrease in myelinated fibers and nonspecific axonal degeneration; electron microscopic studies showed neurofilament accumulation within axons. She had no cranial nerve involvement and remained active with normal cognition at age 18 years.
Pehlivan et al. (2015) reported a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with onset of CMT2R in early infancy. He was noted to have tracheomalacia at age 15 days. At age 6 months, he developed respiratory insufficiency associated with vocal cord paralysis necessitating tracheostomy. At age 16 months, he had axial hypotonia, muscle weakness, increased tone in the lower limbs, knee contracture, hammertoes, pes equinus and pes cavus, and absent deep tendon reflexes. EMG showed markedly reduced amplitudes with decreased motor nerve conductive velocities consistent with severe axonal polyneuropathy. He died of respiratory distress at age 2 years, 9 months.



DCC
**Colorectal cancer, somatic, 114500 (3)**
Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease that is common in both men and women. In addition to lifestyle and environmental risk factors, gene defects can contribute to an inherited predisposition to CRC. CRC is caused by changes in different molecular pathogenic pathways, such as chromosomal instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. Chromosome instability is the most common alteration and is present in almost 85% of all cases (review by Schweiger et al., 2013).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Colorectal Cancer
Mutations in a single gene result in a marked predisposition to colorectal cancer in 2 distinct syndromes: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 175100) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; see 120435). FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene (611731), whereas HNPCC is caused by mutations in several genes, including MSH2 (609309), MLH1 (120436), PMS1 (600258), PMS2 (600259), MSH6 (600678), TGFBR2 (190182), and MLH3 (604395). Epigenetic silencing of MSH2 results in a form of HNPCC (see HNPCC8, 613244). Other colorectal cancer syndromes include autosomal recessive adenomatous polyposis (608456), which is caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene (604933), and oligodontia-colorectal cancer syndrome (608615), which is caused by mutations in the AXIN2 gene (604025).
The CHEK2 gene (604373) has been implicated in susceptibility to colorectal cancer in Finnish patients. A germline mutation in the PLA2G2A gene (172411) was identified in a patient with colorectal cancer.
Germline susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer have also been identified. CRCS1 (608812) is conferred by mutation in the GALNT12 gene (610290) on chromosome 9q22; CRCS2 (611469) maps to chromosome 8q24; CRCS3 (612229) is conferred by variation in the SMAD7 gene (602932) on chromosome 18; CRCS4 (601228) is conferred by variation on 15q that causes increased and ectopic expression of the GREM1 gene (603054); CRCS5 (612230) maps to chromosome 10p14; CRCS6 (612231) maps to chromosome 8q23; CRCS7 (612232) maps to chromosome 11q23; CRCS8 (612589) maps to chromosome 14q22; CRCS9 (612590) maps to 16q22; CRCS10 (612591) is conferred by mutation in the POLD1 gene (174761) on chromosome 19q13; CRCS11 (612592) maps to chromosome 20p12; and CRCS12 (615083) is conferred by mutation in the POLE gene (174762) on chromosome 12q24.
Somatic mutations in many different genes, including KRAS (190070), PIK3CA (171834), BRAF (164757), CTNNB1 (116806), FGFR3 (134934), AXIN2 (604025), AKT1 (164730), MCC (159350), MYH11 (160745), PARK2 (602544), RNF43 (612482), and BUB1 (601452) have been identified in colorectal cancer.
Colon cancer is a well-known feature of familial polyposis coli. Cancer of the colon occurred in 7 members of 4 successive generations of the family reported by Kluge (1964), leading him to suggest a simple genetic basis for colonic cancer independent of polyposis. The combination of colonic and endometrial cancer has been observed in many families (e.g., Williams, 1978).
Sivak et al. (1981) studied a kindred with the familial cancer syndrome in which every confirmed affected member had at least 1 primary carcinoma of the colon. The average age at which cancer appeared was 38 years. Multiple primary neoplasms occurred in 23% of cancer patients.
Budd and Fink (1981) reported a family with a high frequency of mucoid colonic carcinoma. Since endometrial carcinoma, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, uterine leiomyosarcoma, bladder transitional carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma also occurred in the family, this may be the same disorder as the Lynch cancer family syndrome type II (120435).
Bamezai et al. (1984) reported an Indian Sikh kindred in which 8 persons suffered from cancer of the cecum, not associated with polyposis.
Burt et al. (1985) studied a large Utah kindred called to attention because of occurrence of colorectal cancer in a brother, a sister, and a nephew. No clear inheritance pattern was discernible until systematic screening was undertaken for colonic polyps using flexible proctosigmoidoscopy. One or more adenomatous polyps were found in 41 of 191 family members (21%) and 12 of 132 controls (9%)--p less than 0.005. Pedigree analysis showed best fit with autosomal dominant inheritance. Cannon-Albright et al. (1988) extended the studies with investigations of 33 additional kindreds. The kindreds were selected through either a single person with an adenomatous polyp or a cluster of relatives with colonic cancer. The kindreds all had common colorectal cancers, not the rare inherited condition of familial polyposis coli or nonpolyposis inherited colorectal cancer. Likelihood analysis strongly supported dominant inheritance of a susceptibility to colorectal adenomas and cancers, with a gene frequency of 19%. According to the most likely genetic model, adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancers occur only in genetically susceptible persons; however, the 95% confidence interval for this proportion was 53 to 100%.
Ponz de Leon et al. (1992) analyzed data on 605 families of probands with colorectal cancer in the province of Modena in Italy. Among the 577 presumed nonpolyposis cases, both parents had colorectal cancer in 11, one parent in 130, and neither parent in 436. Segregation was compatible with dominant transmission of susceptibility to cancer.
Mecklin (1987) investigated the frequency of hereditary colorectal cancer among all colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in 1 Finnish county during the 1970s. The cancer family syndrome type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma emerged as the most common verifiable risk factor, involving between 3.8 and 5.5% of all colorectal cancer patients. The frequencies of familial adenomatosis and ulcerative colitis were 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The observed frequency is probably an underestimate. The patients with cancer family syndrome were young, accounting for 29 to 39% of the patients under 50 years of age, and their tumors were located predominantly (65%) in the right hemicolon.
**Esophageal carcinoma, somatic, 133239 (3)**
Esophageal cancer, particularly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Both environmental and genetic risk factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In Europe and North America, heavy smoking, alcohol consumption, and increased body mass index (BMI) are the main environmental risk factors. In contrast, the particularly high incidence of ESCC in some areas of China, central Asia, and southern Africa is associated with nutritional deficiencies, high intake of nitrosamine-rich or pickled vegetables, and low socioeconomic status; smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI play a lesser role in these populations. There is a tendency for familial aggregation of ESCC in high-risk geographic areas, suggesting a genetic component to increased susceptibility. Gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is another common type of cancer in China that shows similarities to ESCC in terms of geographic distribution and environmental risk factors (summary by Wang et al., 2010 and Abnet et al., 2010).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Susceptibility to Esophageal Cancer
See a variant in the ADH1B gene (103720.0001) for discussion of a possible genetic association with protection against squamous cell aerodigestive tract cancer, including esophageal cancer, in alcohol drinkers. See a variant in the ALDH2 gene (100650.0001) for discussion of a possible genetic association with increased risk for esophageal cancer in alcohol drinkers due to interaction between variants in the ADH1B and ALDH2 genes.
See the S100A14 gene (607986) on chromosome 1q21 for a discussion of a possible association between variation in that gene and susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma among smokers.
Genetic Heterogeneity of Somatic Mutations in Esophageal Cancer
Somatic mutations in several different genes have been found in esophageal cancer tissue. These genes include TP53 (191170), CDKN2A (600160), DEC1 (604767), DCC (120470), DLEC1 (604050), TGFBR2 (190182), LZTS1 (606551), RNF6 (604242), WWOX (605131), APC (611731), and RUNX3 (600210).
**Gaze palsy, familial horizontal, with progressive scoliosis, 2, 617542 (3), AR**
Jamuar et al. (2017) reported 2 brothers, born of consanguineous Mexican parents, and an unrelated girl, born of consanguineous Saudi Arabian parents, with a similar disorder characterized by global developmental delay, delayed walking, intellectual disability, horizontal gaze palsy, and childhood-onset progressive scoliosis. Brain imaging showed agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), absence of the anterior and hippocampal commissures, hypoplasia of the pons and midbrain, and midline cleft throughout the brainstem, contributing to a butterfly-shaped medulla. In addition, the boys showed hypotonia and mirror movements, although the girl did not. One of the boys had hyperreflexia and ankle clonus. The boys could walk independently and speak in full sentences, whereas the girl had an unsteady gait and used only single words. Diffusion MRI from the Saudi Arabian girl showed striking abnormalities, including no commissural tracts, misguided Probst bundles along the lateral ventricles, disorganized white matter tracts, and decreased axonal integrity and myelination compared to controls. Associational and subcortical fiber tracts were also abnormal, and fibers were arranged in a radial fashion. There was also failure of the superior cerebellar peduncles to decussate and absence of transverse pontine fibers. Associational and subcortical fiber tracts were also abnormal. The parents who were assessed did not show mirror movements, suggesting variability or incomplete penetrance.
**Mirror movements 1 and/or agenesis of the corpus callosum, 157600 (3), AD**
Mirror movements are contralateral involuntary movements that mirror voluntary ones. Whereas mirror movements are occasionally found in normal young children, persistence beyond the age of 10 years is abnormal. Congenital mirror movements tend to persist throughout adulthood and tend to occur more commonly in the upper extremities (summary by Sharafaddinzadeh et al., 2008 and Srour et al., 2010). Some patients with DCC mutations have agenesis of the corpus callosum (Marsh et al., 2017).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Mirror Movements
See also MRMV2 (614508), caused by mutation in the RAD51 gene (179617) on chromosome 15q15; MRMV3 (606059), caused by mutation in the DNAL4 gene (610565) on chromosome 22q13; and MRMV4 (618264), caused by mutation in the NTN1 gene (601614) on chromosome 17p13.
According to Rosemary Harvey (2008), the biographer of William Bateson (1861-1926), Bateson carried on a conversation with H. Drinkwater concerning this condition, which he referred to as bimanual synergia. The patient was a boy who seemed normal in all respects except for the movements of his 2 hands and the sensation in his arms. He could not flex or extend the fingers of one hand without making the same movements with the other hand. Drinkwater found that the condition was hereditary and was transmitted through the mother who herself was normal. The patient's maternal aunt could control the synergic movements but only by a strong effort. The boy's brother had shown the condition in childhood but grew out of it in his early teens and recovered completely. If the boy felt a painful stimulus on one side, he immediately felt it in the same part of the other hand or arm. Drinkwater was said to have sent information on this case to the Neurological Section of the International Medical Congress meeting in London in 1913. In later correspondence, Drinkwater concluded that his pedigree of bimanual synergia did not follow mendelian rules.
Sharafaddinzadeh et al. (2008) reported the 5-generation pedigree of a large Persian-speaking family from the Isfahan province of southeast Iran. There were 17 affected members of this family segregating this autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. There were far more males than females, with a 12 to 5 male-to-female ratio. All affected family members had otherwise completely normal neurologic and psychiatric examinations and brain and cervical MRI. Mirror movements were confirmed by electromyography.
Srour et al. (2009) reported a 4-generation pedigree segregating autosomal dominant congenital mirror movements not associated with other neurologic abnormalities. The family was a French Canadian family originating from the Lanaudiere region of Quebec. There was no known consanguinity. Transmission was autosomal dominant with high but incomplete penetrance. Penetrance was higher in males, with a male-to-female ratio of 9 to 2. Mirror movements were present in the hands, fingers, and forearms of all affected individuals: upon voluntary activation of one hand, the contralateral hand would mirror both simple and complex movements such as writing, typing, and tapping. Three individuals reported mirror movements in the toes and feet which were observable during foot tapping and movement of the toes. In most, mirror movements were noted at birth or infancy, and persisted unchanged throughout life. Half could partially suppress the movements. Despite often high amplitude of usually observable movements, patients functioned essentially normally. One patient worked successfully as an electrician performing high precision bimanual tasks, and another worked as a secretary and could type rapidly. Three reported mild clumsiness during childhood. Several reported social impairment, stating that they felt conspicuous or embarrassed by their muscle movements. Neurologic exam was otherwise normal in all. One had a normal MRI of the brain and cervical cord.
Depienne et al. (2011) reported a 3-generation Italian family in which 4 individuals had mirror movements of the arms and hands with onset in infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals had difficulty in fine bimanual movements, and 1 reported pain and muscle cramping during sustained manual activities. Only 1 patient reported some improvement during childhood; none required treatment.
Clinical Variability
Meneret et al. (2014) reported a family with mirror movements associated with a heterozygous truncating mutation in the DCC gene (R275X; 120470.0006). In a reassessment of this family, Marsh et al. (2017) found that partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) also segregated with the mutation. Two patients with mirror movements had partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, whereas a family member without mirror movements had complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. The family originated from North Africa. The findings indicated that both features are part of the phenotype associated with DCC mutations.
Marsh et al. (2017) reported 3 additional families, 2 from Australia and 1 from North Africa, in which a heterozygous DCC mutation segregated with mirror movements and/or partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Intellectual abilities of the patients ranged from normal to borderline impaired, and some had specific cognitive impairments, including language delay or visuospatial deficits. Diffusion MRI tractography studies showed that mirror movements were consistently associated with decreased crossing of descending corticospinal tract projections at the pyramidal decussation. ACC was associated with absence of the hippocampal commissure and cingulate gyri, as well as dysmorphic lateral ventricles. The individuals had a more favorable outcome compared to unfavorable developmental outcomes associated with syndromic forms of ACC. Marsh et al. (2017) concluded that prenatal detection of isolated ACC related to a pathogenic DCC mutation is indicative of a lower risk of a poor neurodevelopmental outcome, with implications for genetic counseling.



CSF2RA
**Surfactant metabolism dysfunction, pulmonary, 4, 300770 (3)**
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. Three forms of PAP have been described: hereditary (usually congenital), secondary, and acquired. Hereditary PAP is associated with mutations in the CSF2RA gene or in genes encoding surfactant proteins. Secondary PAP develops in conditions in which there are reduced numbers or functional impairment of alveolar macrophages and is associated with inhalation of inorganic dust (silica) or toxic fumes, hematologic malignancies, pharmacologic immunosuppression, infections, and impaired CSF2RB (138960) expression. Acquired PAP (610910), the most common form, usually occurs in adults and is caused by neutralizing autoantibodies to CSF2 (138960) (Martinez-Moczygemba et al., 2008).
For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of congenital pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction, see SMDP1 (265120).
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) reported a 4-year-old female with symptoms associated with Turner syndrome and respiratory insufficiency who had been diagnosed with PAP at age 3 years. She had exhibited respiratory failure caused by respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in the first month of life, with a diagnosis of reactive airways disease. The patient presented with respiratory distress and hypoxemia, with a 'crazy paving' pattern on chest imaging. Open lung biopsy revealed alveolar proteinaceous material without alveolar epithelial hyperplasia or chronic interstitial changes, and bronchoalveolar lavage revealed proteinaceous material and foamy macrophages. ELISA showed no anti-CSF2 antibodies and elevated baseline CSF2 serum levels. Exogenous CSF2 administration, which may be efficacious in some patients with acquired PAP, resulted in no clinical improvement.
Suzuki et al. (2008) reported 2 sisters with PAP. The index patient presented at age 6 years with a 2-year history of progressive tachypnea and failure to thrive. Both parents were well developed and healthy with no history of lung disease. Examination of the patient revealed moderate tachypnea, mild tachycardia, and inspiratory crackles. Pulmonary function testing showed severe restrictive impairment. Oxygen saturation was 88% while breathing room air and decreased while talking or walking a short distance. PAP diagnosis was suspected based on chest radiography and confirmed by histopathologic examination of lung tissue. CSF2 autoantibodies were absent. Serum SPD (SFTPD; 178635) was increased in the patient compared with her parents and controls. The patient's 8-year-old sister, who was thought to be healthy, also had increased serum SPD. Subsequent clinical evaluation revealed that the sister had poor growth, a diffusion capacity for carbon dioxide of 57% that predicted, and mild patchy ground glass opacities throughout both lungs, consistent with a diagnosis of PAP.



SIK1
**Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 30, 616341 (3), AD**
Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-30 (DEE30) is a severe neurologic disorder characterized by onset of refractory seizures soon after birth or in the first months of life. Seizure types include early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), Ohtahara syndrome, and infantile spasms; most are refractory to treatment. Patients with earlier seizure onset make essentially no developmental progress and may die in infancy. Those with later onset show profoundly impaired global development with absent speech, poor eye contact, inability to walk, behavioral abnormalities, and feeding difficulties that may require a feeding tube (summary by Hansen et al., 2015).
For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of DEE, see 308350.
Hansen et al. (2015) reported 6 unrelated children with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder associated with early-onset refractory epilepsy. Seizure onset occurred shortly after birth or within the first months of life and included myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, and atonic seizures, as well as infantile spasms. All patients had severely delayed psychomotor development. Two patients died in infancy, and the 4 who survived showed severe cognitive impairment with poor or absent speech and autistic features. EEG showed variable abnormalities, such as burst suppression patterns, multifocal spikes, slowed background activity, and hypsarrhythmia. Brain imaging, when performed, was normal. Additional features included abnormal involuntary movements, poor spontaneous movement, poor visual and/or auditory responses, bruxism, poor feeding, and respiratory insufficiency.

Sambrotta et al. (2014) reported 12 patients from 8 families with early childhood onset of severe progressive liver disease. One child died at age 13 months, 9 patients required a liver transplant, and 2 had stable liver disease with mild portal hypertension at ages 4 and 7 years, respectively. Laboratory studies showed normal or mildly increased GGT levels. No additional clinical details were given. Most of the families were consanguineous.
Zhou et al. (2015) reported 2 patients with PFIC4 who developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The first was a 26-month-old Caucasian female who had had intermittent jaundice of neonatal onset and normal GGT. She presented in acute liver failure. CT scan showed innumerable well-defined hepatic masses. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; 104150) was 171,000 ng/mL, and liver biopsy found moderately differentiated HCC in a background of chronic cholestatic hepatitis with cirrhosis. The patient died 3 weeks after admission. An autopsy confirmed multifocal HCC. The second patient was a 6-month-old Caucasian male referred for persistent cholestasis with near-normal GGT after hepatoportoenterostomy for presumed biliary atresia. Icterus resolved by 19 months, but a growing lesion in the right liver lobe, with rising serum AFP, prompted liver transplantation at 2 years of age. The explanted liver was cirrhotic, with multiple cholestatic nodules and a single, well-encapsulated 2-cm tumor that diffusely expressed AFP and glypican-3 (300037); a central region of well-differentiated HCC was found. The patient was well post 2 years transplantation. Zhou et al. (2015) concluded that mutations in TJP2 resulting in progressive intrahepatic cholestasis may predispose to hepatocellular carcinoma in early childhood, warranting close monitoring and early liver transplantation.
**Hypercholanemia, familial, 607748 (3), AR**
Familial hypercholanemia is characterized by elevated serum bile acid concentrations, itching, and fat malabsorption (Morton et al., 2000; Shneider et al., 1997). Carlton et al. (2003) identified 17 individuals with familial hypercholanemia in 12 families of Lancaster County Old Order Amish descent. Serum bile acid concentration in affected individuals fluctuated, being often very high but occasionally normal. Fat malabsorption, reflecting low intestinal bile acid levels, manifested by failure to thrive, potentially life-threatening vitamin K-dependent coagulopathy, and rickets. Symptoms usually responded to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Familial hypercholanemia is atypical for a liver disease; test results of biochemical markers of liver injury were normal, except for alkaline phosphatase activity, which sometimes rose. Liver biopsy findings varied; 1 untreated individual had canalicular cholestasis and 2 individuals receiving UDCA had minimally active chronic hepatitis. Several older individuals had become symptom-free and discontinued UDCA treatment.



TCF3
**Agammaglobulinemia 8, autosomal dominant, 616941 (3), AD**
Dobbs et al. (2011) and Boisson et al. (2013) reported 4 unrelated patients who presented in the first years of life with severe infections, including pneumococcal meningitis, recurrent otitis, vaccine-associated polio, and arthritis. Laboratory studies showed severely decreased levels of serum immunoglobulins and less than 3% of CD19+ circulating B cells. The B cells showed high-intensity expression of CD19, but absence of the B-cell receptor (BCR). Bone marrow biopsy from 2 patients showed a severe reduction in the number of pro- and pre-B cells. Detailed analysis of patient B cells showed that they did not bear surface immunoglobulins.

**Thrombophilia due to protein C deficiency, autosomal dominant, 176860 (3), AD**
Heterozygous protein C deficiency is characterized by recurrent venous thrombosis. However, many adults with heterozygous disease may be asymptomatic (Millar et al., 2000). Individuals with decreased amounts of protein C are classically referred to as having type I deficiency and those with normal amounts of a functionally defective protein as having type II deficiency (Bertina et al., 1984).
Acquired protein C deficiency is a clinically similar disorder caused by development of an antibody against protein C. Clouse and Comp (1986) reviewed the structural and functional properties of protein C and discussed both hereditary and acquired deficiency of protein C.
Griffin et al. (1981) reported a 22-year-old Caucasian man with recurrent thrombophlebitis complicated by pulmonary embolism. His 56-year-old father had thrombophlebitis with pulmonary embolism following a minor leg injury at age 24, a cerebrovascular accident at age 43, and a myocardial infarction at age 45. A paternal uncle had thrombophlebitis and recurrent pulmonary emboli dating from age 20. The paternal grandfather died abruptly at age 45 after developing pulmonary infiltrates while confined to bed due to a leg injury in a fall from a horse. The paternal great-grandfather died unexpectedly of a cerebrovascular accident at age 61. The propositus, his father, and his paternal uncle showed decreased levels of plasma protein C antigen, determined immunologically by the Laurell rocket technique, that were 38 to 49% of normal values. Clinically unaffected members of the kindred had normal levels.
Bertina et al. (1984) and Barbui et al. (1984) reported families with a discrepancy between normal protein C antigen levels and low functional activity of protein C. The proband in the latter report was a man with myocardial infarction at age 28 and severe thrombotic episodes thereafter, including cerebral thrombophlebitis, and both superficial and deep venous thrombosis of the leg. Although no other member of the family had a history of thromboses, the father also was found to have decreased functional activity of protein C. Immunoelectrophoretic studies showed an abnormal migration pattern of the protein, which the authors termed 'protein C Bergamo.'
Using an immunologic and a functional assay, Horellou et al. (1984) identified 22 patients from 9 French families with protein C deficiency. Six were asymptomatic, 15 had a history of venous thromboembolism, and 1 had a history of arterial thromboembolism. The first thrombotic episode occurred at a mean age of 24.1 years. Five patients (56%) had absence of a precipitating condition. One patient with severe protein C deficiency developed skin necrosis soon after starting oral anticoagulant treatment. Family history suggested autosomal dominant transmission of the defect.
Israels and Seshia (1987) described stroke in a 17-month-old girl with heterozygous protein C deficiency.
In a large New England kindred, Bovill et al. (1989) found a strong statistical correlation between thromboembolic disease and heterozygous protein C deficiency. On the other hand, they found no thromboembolic manifestations in many protein C-deficient family members, indicating that some factors other than heterozygous protein C deficiency must play an important role in the clinical expression.
Berdeaux et al. (1993) described 11 subjects from 3 families with dysfunctional protein C, or type II deficiency, characterized by a disproportionate decrease in protein C activity compared to the amount of antigen. In their own series, 4 of the 11 patients were symptomatic. They compared the findings in these subjects with those in 67 reported patients, including 39 symptomatic and 28 asymptomatic, with dysfunctional protein C deficiency.
In a study in the Netherlands, Allaart et al. (1993) found a significant difference in the thrombosis-free survival of 77 heterozygotes and 84 controls in the same families: by age 45, 50% of the heterozygotes and 10% of normal relatives had a manifestation of venous thromboembolism. Thrombotic events occurred more often in years in which the patient had been immobile for more than a week or had had surgery. There was no predisposing event such as surgery or pregnancy in 50% of all first episodes and 65% of recurrences of venous thromboembolism in the heterozygotes.
Acquired Protein C Deficiency
Using an electroimmunoassay, Mannucci and Vigano (1982) evaluated acquired protein C deficiency in conditions associated with an increased tendency to thrombosis.
Mitchell et al. (1987) described a fatal thrombophilia associated with the development of an antibody to protein C. Acquired nonmendelian autoimmune phenocopies are known for several other disorders, including dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (226600), hemophilia A (306700), hereditary angioedema (106100), and von Willebrand disease (see 193400).
Gruppo et al. (2000) reported a 20-month-old child with acquired protein C deficiency who had a stroke while receiving valproic acid for a seizure disorder. They studied 20 children on valproic acid therapy and 20 children receiving other anticonvulsants and found that protein C levels were reduced to less than 5% of normal in up to 45% of the children receiving valproic acid.
**Thrombophilia due to protein C deficiency, autosomal recessive, 612304 (3), AR**
Autosomal recessive protein C deficiency resulting from homozygous or compound heterozygous PROC mutations is a thrombotic condition that can manifest as a severe neonatal disorder or as a milder disorder with late-onset thrombophilia (Millar et al., 2000).
Branson et al. (1983) reported a newborn male infant with intractable purpura fulminans, which reflected massive subcutaneous thrombosis. His mother had heterozygous protein C deficiency. This was the first instance in which protein C deficiency was implicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Seligsohn et al. (1984) studied an Arab-Israeli family in which 2 sibs with first-cousin parents died with massive venous thrombosis in the neonatal period. Both parents and several other relatives, who were heterozygous carriers, had had no thrombotic episodes.
Marlar (1985) diagnosed complete deficiency of protein C in 5 infants. The major symptom was massive subcutaneous thrombosis that usually started within the first 24 hours of life.
Peters et al. (1988) described a patient with neonatal purpura fulminans and severe bilateral vitreous hemorrhages. The patient showed reduced protein C antigen levels with undetectable activity levels. Infusions of fresh frozen plasma were given for 8 months.
Gruppo et al. (1988) reported a child who had renal vein thrombosis as a newborn and iliofemoral thrombosis at the age of 6 years. Protein C levels and anticoagulant activity were decreased to 47% and 14% of normal, respectively. A 3-year-old asymptomatic sib had a similar reduction of PROC anticoagulant activity. The mother had type I protein C deficiency with a proportionate reduction in immunologic protein levels (59%) and anticoagulant activity (52%), whereas the father had type II PROCC deficiency with normal immunologic protein levels (102%), and low anticoagulant function (50%). Electrophoretic studies showed an abnormal protein C in the father and both children. Gruppo et al. (1988) concluded that the children were compound heterozygous for the 2 different types of PROC deficiency inherited from each of the parents.
Tuddenham et al. (1989) reported a consanguineous family in which 2 members had homozygous protein C deficiency. Both presented in the second half of their first year of life with recurrent rapidly disappearing ecchymotic skin lesions, DIC, and venous thrombosis. The authors noted that homozygous deficiency usually presents in the neonatal period. Successful treatment was achieved by frequent infusions of plasma or prothrombin complex with warfarin maintenance.
Dreyfus et al. (1991) stated that at least 19 cases of life-threatening neonatal thrombosis and purpura fulminans had been described.
Fong et al. (2010) reported 2 sisters with autosomal recessive protein C deficiency who had extensive bilateral periventricular hemorrhagic infarction causing spastic cerebral palsy. The older sister presented at 20 months with cortical visual blindness, spastic diplegia, and purpura fulminans. The younger sister presented at age 3 days with apneas and multifocal seizures. At age 2 years, she had global developmental delay, cortical visual blindness, spastic quadriplegia, epilepsy, and purpura fulminans. Neuroimaging of both sibs showed findings consistent with bilateral cerebral intramedullary venous thrombosis occurring at under 28 weeks' gestation for the older sister and around time of birth for the younger sister. Laboratory studies showed severe qualitative reduction in plasma protein C anticoagulant activity.
Clinical Variability
Melissari and Kakkar (1989) reported 2 unrelated families in which 4 adults had severe protein C deficiency with less than or equal to 5% of normal plasma levels. Newborn deaths were reported in the first family but not in the second family. Adult patients developed thrombotic symptoms mainly in their early twenties, characterized by recurrent superficial and deep iliofemoral vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli. Other clinical features included generalized peritonitis due to massive mesenteric vein thrombosis, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, renal vein thrombosis, and priapism. In the second family, 5 individuals died of intravascular abdominal thrombosis at about 40 years of age. Massive thromboembolic episodes were associated with a compensated DIC syndrome. Clinical symptoms could be controlled by long-term administration of low molecular weight heparin alone or in combination with low dose warfarin.
Tripodi et al. (1990) reported a family in which 2 protein C deficiency homozygotes with similarly low protein C levels had mild disease. One had recurrent venous thrombosis starting at the age of 28 years, and the other was still asymptomatic at 38 years despite exposure to thrombotic risk factors. A review of 13 additional homozygotes revealed a highly variable phenotypic expression, which the authors subdivided into 2 groups. In the first group, affected homozygotes from 8 kindreds presented at birth with unmeasurable protein C levels and life-threatening thrombosis, whereas affected homozygous individuals of 1 kindred had very low levels of protein C and delayed onset of thrombosis at about 10 months of age. In a second group of 4 kindreds, homozygotes had very low, but measurable, protein C levels and survived into adulthood with histories of moderately severe thrombosis. Tripodi et al. (1990) noted that the findings in their family demonstrated that protein C levels lower than 10% are compatible with a negative history for thrombosis, not only in the neonatal period but also during adulthood. These results suggested that other factors need to interact for full clinical penetrance of the defect in some homozygotes.
**Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, 266150 (3), AR**
PC deficiency may be categorized into 3 phenotypic subgroups. Patients from North America ('group A') have lactic acidemia and psychomotor retardation, whereas those from France and the United Kingdom ('group B') have a more complex biochemical phenotype with increased serum lactate, ammonia, citrulline, and lysine, as well as an intracellular redox disturbance in which the cytosolic compartment is more reduced and the mitochondrial compartment is more oxidized. Patients in group B have decreased survival compared to group A, and usually do not survive beyond 3 months of age (Robinson et al., 1987). Group C is relatively benign.
North American Phenotype ('Group A')
Tada et al. (1969) reported a family in which 2 sisters were presumably affected with the same physical and mental retardation. The proband had elevated serum alanine and pyruvate, normal SGPT and liver pyruvate decarboxylase activities, but decreased activity of pyruvate carboxylase. Hyperalaninemia was likely secondary to the increased level of pyruvate.
Delvin et al. (1972) noted that 2 forms of pyruvate carboxylase exist in liver, one with a high Km and the other with a low Km for pyruvate. They reported a patient with abnormality of gluconeogenesis and elevated plasma levels of pyruvate, lactate, and alanine in which the low Km enzyme was deficient.
Atkin et al. (1979) reported a child with lactic acidosis, severe mental and developmental retardation, and proximal renal acidosis. Laboratory studies showed severe hepatic, renal cortical, and cerebral deficiencies of pyruvate carboxylase activity. Postmortem neuropathologic examination revealed no signs of Leigh syndrome (256000), but developmental and degenerative lesions were observed. Oizumi et al. (1983) reported a patient with PC deficiency associated with renal tubular acidosis and cystinuria.
Haworth et al. (1981) reported 2 unrelated Canadian Indian infants with PC deficiency. Both presented in infancy with metabolic acidosis. Laboratory findings included increased plasma lactate, pyruvate, glutamic acid, proline, and alanine, and low PC activity in skin fibroblasts and liver. Both survived until at least 2 years of age with severe mental retardation.
Gilbert et al. (1983) reported a case of Leigh necrotizing encephalopathy due to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency.
Carbone et al. (1998) studied 11 males and 6 females from several Canadian Indian populations. Presentation was at birth in 7, and 1 to 8.5 months in 10. Presenting signs included metabolic acidosis in 10, seizures in 5, respiratory distress in 4, pneumonia in 3, and hypotonia in 3. The clinical course was characterized by frequent lactic acidosis, severe developmental delay, and muscular hypotonia in 17, seizures in 8, hypoglycemia in 4, and other CNS involvement (clonus or athetosis) in 4. Eleven patients died between ages 3 months and 4.75 years; 6 were surviving at ages ranging from 3 months to 19 years.
'French form' ('Group B')
The second form of PC deficiency, reported particularly from France, presents early with lactic acidosis, but also shows elevated blood levels of ammonia, citrulline, proline, and lysine. In addition, there is an intracellular redox disturbance, with increased lactate/pyruvate and acetoacetate/beta-hydroxybutyrate ratios.
Saudubray et al. (1976) reported 2 familial cases of neonatal congenital lactic acidosis with liver PC deficiency. Disease onset was immediately after birth, characterized by major neurologic symptoms, hyperammonemia, and hyperketonemia. Hyperlactic acidemia was associated with an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio and an increased acetoacetate/beta-hydroxybutyrate ratio. The authors suggested that the unusual metabolic pattern resulted from decreased oxaloacetate synthesis resulting from PC deficiency and impaired oxaloacetate-dependent mitochondrial redox shuttles. The disease course was rapidly fatal. Coude et al. (1981) and Bartlett et al. (1984) also reported patients with the group B type of PC deficiency.
Robinson et al. (1984) reported 8 patients from 7 families from Canada with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. Five were of full Amerindian descent, 2 were unrelated Caucasians, and 1 was the offspring of related Egyptian parents. All presented from soon after birth to age 5 months with chronic metabolic acidosis, and 4 had at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia. Six patients died by age 2 years (range 10 days to 2 years), and the 2 living patients were mentally and physically retarded. Using (3)H-biotin labeling and (35)S-streptavidin to detect biotin-containing proteins, and immunodetection with PC antibodies, Robinson et al. (1984) distinguished 2 groups of patients: group 'A' synthesized PC subunits with a normal molecular mass and recognized by antibodies against PC, but showed very little enzymatic activity, (termed CRM(+ve) or type I), whereas group 'B' had no detectable PC subunits and no protein recognized by the antibody (termed CRM(-ve), or type II). The 2 patients with CRM(-ve) results, the Egyptian patient and 1 of the Caucasian patients, had additional biochemical features, including hyperammonemia, citrullinemia, lysinemia, and altered redox states (in 1 patient) similar to the features of patients reported in France. These 2 patients also died early (10 days and 7 weeks) and had hepatomegaly due to excessive fat storage. Robinson et al. (1984) concluded that the 2 subtle types of PC deficiency result from 2 different mutations in the PC gene, 1 that synthesizes an inactive protein and 1 that results in lack of protein expression.
In a follow-up study of cultured skin fibroblasts from 16 patients with either French or American PC deficiency, Robinson et al. (1987) confirmed that the North American cases are associated with the presence of a mature biotin-containing protein of the correct molecular weight. Three families with the French presentation had absence of immunoreactive PC protein and PC mRNA; however, another 3 families with the French presentation had evidence of protein production as well as PC mRNA. Robinson et al. (1987) concluded that when a PC enzyme is produced in French cases, it has no activity.
Pineda et al. (1995) reported an infant with what they termed the 'French' type of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, with somewhat less severity. The initial neonatal symptoms were respiratory distress, severe metabolic acidosis, and a tendency to hypoglycemia. At age 6 months, he presented with acute neurologic symptoms, lactic acidosis, and hyperammonemia, and died of pneumonia, cardiac failure, and renal insufficiency. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency was confirmed by enzymatic studies. Postmortem analysis showed periventricular cysts and diffuse hypomyelination.
Brun et al. (1999) reported brother and sister with the severe form of PC deficiency. Both had macrocephaly and severe ischemia-like brain lesions at birth and died in the first week of life with intractable lactic acidemia. In the girl, increased head circumference and periventricular leukomalacia were detected on fetal ultrasonography at 29.4 weeks of gestation. PC activity in cultured skin fibroblasts was less than 2% of control. The lesions were detected at a time of maximal periventricular metabolic demand. Brun et al. (1999) postulated that energy deprivation induced by PC deficiency impairs astrocytic buffering capacity against excitotoxic insult and compromises normal microvascular morphogenesis and autoregulation, both mechanisms leading to cystic degeneration of the periventricular white matter. The authors noted that discovery of cystic periventricular leukomalacia on cerebral ultrasound at birth in a newborn presenting with primary lactic acidemia is highly suggestive of PC deficiency.
'Benign' type ('Group C')
Van Coster et al. (1991) reported a 7-year-old girl with metabolic and biochemical features of the North American type of PC deficiency who had a benign disease course with preservation of motor and mental abilities. She had several episodes of metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, lysine, and proline values, which were well-managed by rehydration and bicarbonate therapy. PC activity was 1.8% of normal, and she was CRM(+ve). The authors commented on the unique phenotypic expression in this patient.
Schiff et al. (2006) reported a patient with atypical PC deficiency and long survival. He presented at 3 days of age with acute ketoacidosis, tachypnea, and hypotonia. Laboratory studies showed lactacidemia with normal plasma amino acids and ammonia. After successful treatment, he was discharged with an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio and avoidance of fasting was advised. During the first 2 years of life, he had mild psychomotor delay and failure to thrive with intermittent acute decompensation. PC activity in cultured skin fibroblasts was severely decreased, leading to the correct diagnosis. Brain MRI at age 18 months showed bilateral high signal intensities in frontoparietal subcortical white matter. At the time of the report, he was 9 years old and showed mild and global psychomotor delay with dysarthria and dysgraphia. Treatment included biotin, L-carnitine, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, and avoidance of fasting. Schiff et al. (2006) noted that relatively long survival into childhood is not a frequent finding for this usually very severe disease.



SLC38A8
**Foveal hypoplasia 2, with or without optic nerve misrouting and/or anterior segment dysgenesis, 609218 (3), AR**
Foveal hypoplasia is defined as the lack of foveal depression with continuity of all neurosensory retinal layers in the presumed foveal area. Foveal hypoplasia as an isolated entity is a rare phenomenon; it is usually described in association with other ocular disorders, such as aniridia (106210), microphthalmia (see 251600), albinism (see 203100), or achromatopsia (see 216900). All reported cases of foveal hypoplasia have been accompanied by decreased visual acuity and nystagmus (summary by Perez et al., 2014).
For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of foveal hypoplasia, see FVH1 (136520).
Pal et al. (2004) described foveal hypoplasia and anterior segment dysgenesis in a large consanguineous pedigree. Five members of the pedigree presented with nystagmus and poor vision. The parents were unaffected. The combination of developmental abnormalities in both anterior and posterior eye structures suggested a defect in early ocular development and morphogenesis.
Van Genderen et al. (2006) reported 2 Afghan sisters and a Dutch girl with foveal hypoplasia and optic chiasm misrouting, but no albinism. The Dutch girl had previously been diagnosed with Kartagener syndrome (see 244400). All 3 patients exhibited nystagmus, and fundus examination showed absence of the usual foveal hyperpigmentation, foveal avascular zone, and macular and foveal reflexes, with small retinal vessels extending through the presumed macular area. The exit angles of the main temporal arteries were below the mean -2 SD of those seen in albino patients and well within the range of angles in controls. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the Dutch girl showed extension of all neurosensory retinal layers through the area in which the fovea would normally be located; no clivus, anticlivus, or foveal pit could be seen. Visual evoked potential (VEP) recordings yielded chiasmal coefficients significantly indicative of misrouting in all 3 patients. The affected girls were all dark haired with dark brown eyes and no iris transillumination; the Dutch girl tanned normally and the Afghan sisters had skin color similar to that of other family members. Parents and sibs in both families were unaffected.
Vincent et al. (2009) described a father and 2 daughters with foveal hypoplasia from a highly consanguineous Indian family. All 3 patients had poor vision, horizontal pendular nystagmus, and alternating esotropia, with normal color vision. Fundus examination of the 40-year-old father showed a poorly defined foveal zone in both eyes and a large typical inferior chorioretinal coloboma in the right eye; in addition, the axial length in both eyes was less than 19 mm, consistent with microphthalmia. In his 9-year-old and 6-year-old daughters, fundus examination showed bilateral absence of foveal reflex, and OCT demonstrated absence of foveal pits bilaterally; electroretinographic recordings were normal in both. The older daughter was also diagnosed with bilateral microphthalmia, with axial lengths less than 20 mm in both eyes, whereas in the younger daughter, axial lengths were 20.70 mm and 20.54 mm in the right and left eyes, respectively. The father was born of a consanguineous marriage, and was married to his unaffected niece; there was 1 unaffected daughter. The father's older sister and a paternal aunt and uncle were reported to have poor vision, esotropia, and nystagmus.
Perez et al. (2014) studied 9 patients from 3 apparently unrelated nonconsanguineous Israeli families of Jewish Indian (Mumbai region) ancestry with nystagmus and subnormal vision from infancy. Visual acuities ranged between 20/50 and 20/200; refractive errors were found in all patients and varied between moderate hypermetropia and high myopia. All patients had astigmatism, and 3 had strabismus. All had normal cutaneous and ocular pigmentation and no iris transillumination, and full-field electroretinography and flash VEP testing in 6 patients were within normal limits. Fundus examination in all patients revealed foveal hypoplasia; OCT, performed in 1 patient, showed absence of the normal foveal pit. The 3 affected sisters in 1 family also had mild developmental delay and pervasive developmental disorder-like features.
Al-Araimi et al. (2013) restudied the Pakistani family with foveal hypoplasia and anterior segment dysgenesis originally reported by Pal et al. (2004). Flash VEP in 2 affected family members showed contralateral predominance, indicating increased crossover at optic chiasm. Reexamination of the 2 Afghan sisters who were originally described by van Genderen et al. (2006) revealed posterior embryotoxon in both. Al-Araimi et al. (2013) concluded that both families had the same clinical phenotype, which they designated 'FHONDA' syndrome, representing foveal hypoplasia, optic nerve decussation defects, and anterior segment dysgenesis in the absence of albinism.



MLPH
**Griscelli syndrome, type 3, 609227 (3), AR**
Sanal et al. (2002) reported 2 patients with silver-gray hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes who had large clumps of pigment, typical of Griscelli syndrome, on microscopic analysis of their hair shafts. The patients developed no other manifestations over 6 and 8 years of follow-up, respectively.



ETFA
**Glutaric acidemia IIA, 231680 (3), AR**
Glutaric aciduria II (GA2) is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of fatty acid, amino acid, and choline metabolism. It differs from GA I (GA1; 231670) in that multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies result in large excretion not only of glutaric acid, but also of lactic, ethylmalonic, butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl-butyric, and isovaleric acids. GA II results from deficiency of any 1 of 3 molecules: the alpha (ETFA) and beta (ETFB) subunits of electron transfer flavoprotein, and electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH). The clinical picture of GA II due to the different defects appears to be indistinguishable; each defect can lead to a range of mild or severe cases, depending presumably on the location and nature of the intragenic lesion, i.e., mutation, in each case (Goodman, 1993; Olsen et al., 2003).
The heterogeneous clinical features of patients with MADD fall into 3 classes: a neonatal-onset form with congenital anomalies (type I), a neonatal-onset form without congenital anomalies (type II), and a late-onset form (type III). The neonatal-onset forms are usually fatal and are characterized by severe nonketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, multisystem involvement, and excretion of large amounts of fatty acid- and amino acid-derived metabolites. Symptoms and age at presentation of late-onset MADD are highly variable and characterized by recurrent episodes of lethargy, vomiting, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hepatomegaly often preceded by metabolic stress. Muscle involvement in the form of pain, weakness, and lipid storage myopathy also occurs. The organic aciduria in patients with the late-onset form of MADD is often intermittent and only evident during periods of illness or catabolic stress (summary by Frerman and Goodman, 2001).
Importantly, riboflavin treatment has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms and metabolic profiles in many MADD patients, particularly those with type III, the late-onset and mildest form (Liang et al., 2009).
Neonatal Onset
In the son of healthy parents from the same small town in Turkey, Przyrembel et al. (1976) described fatal neonatal acidosis and hypoglycemia with a strong 'sweaty feet' odor. Large amounts of glutaric acid were found in the blood and urine. The defect was tentatively located to the metabolism of a range of acyl-CoA compounds. A possibly identically affected child died earlier.
Lehnert et al. (1982), Bohm et al. (1982), and others described malformations with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency: congenital polycystic kidneys, characteristic facies, etc.
Typical clinical features of the disorder are respiratory distress, muscular hypotonia, sweaty feet odor, hepatomegaly, and death often in the neonatal period. Of the 12 previously reported cases reviewed by Niederwieser et al. (1983), 7 died in the first 5 days of life and only 2 patients survived to ages 5 and 19 years.
Harkin et al. (1986) described apparently characteristic and perhaps pathognomonic, cytoplasmic, homogeneous, and moderately electron-dense membrane-limited bodies in the central nervous system and renal tissues of a female patient who died at age 5 days. The kidneys were enlarged with numerous cortical cysts. Selective proximal tubular damage leads to glycosuria and generalized amino aciduria. The patient came from an inbred Louisiana Cajun community and had a sib who also died in the newborn period.
Patients with severe deficiency of the ETF dehydrogenase type have distinctive congenital malformations, whereas those with ETF deficiency do not; the severity of the metabolic block, rather than its location, and the resulting profound acidosis in utero may disturb normal morphogenesis. Colevas et al. (1988) described the pathologic findings in 2 cases. The pattern of lesions, in particular the striking localization of renal dysplasia to the medulla, suggested that the malformations may be the consequence of an accumulation of toxic metabolites that is not corrected by placental transfer. Other malformations included cerebral pachygyria, pulmonary hypoplasia, and facial dysmorphism. Lipid accumulation was demonstrated in the liver, heart, and renal tubular epithelium, all tissues that use fatty acids as a primary source of energy.
Wilson et al. (1989) found reports of malformations in 8 of 16 cases. The anomalies included macrocephaly, large anterior fontanel, high forehead, flat nasal bridge, telecanthus, and malformed ears. Abnormalities such as hypotonia, cerebral gliosis, heterotopias, hepatomegaly, hepatic periportal necrosis, polycystic kidneys, and genital defects were considered reminiscent of the anomalies in Zellweger syndrome, but elevations of glutaric, ethylmalonic, adipic, and isovaleric acids were considered distinctive for glutaric aciduria type II. Wilson et al. (1989) described a unique ultrastructural change in the glomerular basement membrane which they suggested may represent an early stage in renal cyst formation and provide a diagnostic criterion for glutaric aciduria II when enzyme studies are unavailable.
Poplawski et al. (1999) reported a family in which an unexplained neonatal death had occurred. Twelve years after the death, they retrospectively diagnosed multiple acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase deficiency by demonstrating an abnormal acyl-carnitine profile in the child's archived neonatal screening card, using tandem mass spectrometry.
Angle and Burton (2008) reported 3 unrelated infants with genetically confirmed MADD who experienced sudden acute life-threatening events in the first year of life, resulting in death in 2 infants. All had been correctly diagnosed via a newborn screening protocol. Each developed cardiopulmonary arrest concurrent with metabolic stress or limited caloric intake, including vomiting, upper respiratory infection, and rotaviral diarrhea. Although only 1 patient had a documented arrhythmia, Angle and Burton (2008) suggested that an intrinsic abnormality of myocardial function due to altered energy production may have played a role. The authors emphasized the importance of aggressive nutritional management in infants with MADD.
Later Onset
Hypoglycemia caused by inborn errors of metabolism, including disturbances of organic-acid metabolism, usually appear during infancy or childhood. Thus, the case reported by Dusheiko et al. (1979) was unusual. A 19-year-old woman had episodic vomiting, severe hypoglycemia, and fatty infiltration of the liver. The parents were not related. One of her sisters, at age 7, developed nausea, vomiting, and a 'stale' odor to the breath, and died after 3 days in hypoglycemic coma. At age 10, a second sister was found to have jaundice, hepatomegaly, and hypoglycemia after an acute febrile illness. She recovered from that illness but died 'in her sleep' 2 years later. Excess amounts of glutaric and ethylmalonic acids were found in the urine, consistent with defective dehydrogenation of isovaleryl CoA and butyryl CoA, respectively. These organic acids plus others are excreted in the urine in excess in Jamaican vomiting sickness, caused by the ingestion of unripe akee. Unripe akee contains the toxin hypoglycin, which inhibits several acyl CoA dehydrogenases. Cultured fibroblasts in the patient of Dusheiko et al. (1979) showed reduced ability to oxidize radiolabeled butyrate and lysine.
Mongini et al. (1992) reported a 25-year-old woman who complained of episodes of muscle weakness, nausea and vomiting since the age of 10 years. She had been born with bilateral cataracts and strabismus. Muscle biopsy showed free fatty acid accumulation. Low-fat diet reduced the episodes of muscle weakness.
Horvath et al. (2006) reported 3 unrelated patients with myopathy associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency: a 32-year-old German woman who developed proximal muscle weakness during pregnancy; a 29-year-old Turkish man who developed difficulty walking and premature fatigue; and a 6-year-old Hungarian boy who had exercise intolerance and generalized hypotonia. All patients had significantly increased serum creatine kinase, increased serum lactate, myopathic changes on EMG, and hypo- or areflexia. None had myoglobinuria, ataxia, or seizures. Muscle biopsies showed lipid storage myopathy, respiratory chain complex deficiencies, and CoQ10 levels below 50% of normal. All 3 patients showed marked improvement after 3 to 6 months of oral CoQ10 supplementation. Gempel et al. (2007) reported follow-up on the patients reported by Horvath et al. (2006). The German woman had developed abnormal liver enzymes and recurrence of muscle weakness, and laboratory studies showed increased multiple acyl-CoA derivatives in serum. The Turkish man had proximal muscle weakness with scapular winging and waddling gait, and laboratory studies were consistent with MADD. Gempel et al. (2007) also reported 5 patients from 3 additional consanguineous families with late-onset MADD manifest as childhood-onset muscle weakness, muscle pain, and increased serum creatine kinase. All 7 patients responded favorably to riboflavin and/or coenzyme Q supplementation. Muscle biopsies showed a myopathy with lipid accumulation and small vacuoles; only 2 patients had ragged-red fibers. All had a decrease of respiratory complex I+III and II+III activity, and all had decreased muscle CoQ10 levels. Molecular analysis identified biallelic pathogenic mutations in the ETFDH gene in all patients (see, e.g., 231675.0007 and 231675.0008), thus confirming the diagnosis of MADD. Gempel et al. (2007) concluded that MADD due to ETFDH mutations can result in isolated myopathy with secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency.
Liang et al. (2009) reported 4 Taiwanese patients from 3 unrelated families with MADD due to mutations in the ETFDH gene (231675.0003-231675.0005). There was marked phenotypic variability, even between 2 affected sibs with the same genotype. The first patient was a 27-year-old woman who had exercise intolerance since early childhood. In her teens, she developed several episodes of acute pancreatitis. At age 19, she developed dysphagia with progressive weakness of neck and proximal limb muscles, and later had a more severe episode of muscle weakness with acute respiratory failure, but no metabolic acidosis and hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Serum creatine kinase was elevated, and muscle biopsy showed increased lipid droplets predominantly in type 1 fibers. Urinary profile was consistent with MADD. Her older sister had a milder phenotype, with 2 bouts of muscle weakness and difficulty climbing stairs and combing her hair. She never had metabolic crisis, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, or respiratory failure. Laboratory studies showed low serum carnitine, increased serum acylcarnitine levels, and elevated glutaric, ethylmalonic, 2-hydroxylglutaric, 3-methylglutaconic, and lactic acids in urine. Both patients responded well to riboflavin and carnitine treatment. The third patient developed exercise intolerance, dysphagia, poor head control, and limb weakness at age 14 years, and was wheelchair-bound by age 16. He had neck and proximal muscle weakness with wasting, lordosis, winged scapula, and absent tendon reflexes. He did not have metabolic acidosis or hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated a severe restrictive ventilatory defect. Muscle biopsy showed increased lipid droplets predominantly in type 1 fibers. He also responded well to riboflavin and carnitine treatment. The last patient was a 10-year-old girl who was a slow runner since childhood. She had an upper respiratory tract infection followed by progressive proximal muscle weakness. A few days after discharge from the hospital, her condition rapidly deteriorated and she developed fatal cardiopulmonary failure associated with marked metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia.
Lan et al. (2010) reported 7 Han Taiwanese patients with genetically confirmed MADD. The patients were identified retrospectively by review of muscle biopsies ascertained for lipid storage myopathy, and all were asymptomatic when recruited. The age at diagnosis ranged from 7 to 43 years, and the patients' ages at the time of the report were between 22 and 44 years. All had a history of episodic myalgia and limb weakness predominantly affecting the proximal muscles during an acute stage of myopathy. Four had dysphagia and 2 had respiratory failure. Serum creatine kinase was increased during the acute attacks. Three had 1 episode, whereas 4 had recurrent episodes. Four patients had extramuscular features, including encephalopathy, seizures, hypoglycemia, and heart failure in 1; vomiting and cardiac arrhythmia in 1; encephalopathy, liver function impairment and lactic acidosis in 1; and vomiting and liver function impairment in 1. All except 1 regained normal muscle strength after the acute stage. Trigger factors in some patients included prolonged fasting and exercise. Blood analysis showed increased acylcarnitines ranging from C8 to C16. Genetic analysis showed that 6 of the patients were homozygous for an A84T mutation in the ETFDH gene (231675.0003), and 1 was compound heterozygous for A84T and R175H (231675.0006). This patient also had a heterozygous substitution in the PNPLA2 gene (609059), which was not thought to contribute to the phenotype.



EYS
**Retinitis pigmentosa 25, 602772 (3), AR**
Collin et al. (2008) examined 6 affected individuals from 3 families with retinitis pigmentosa, all but 1 of whom displayed characteristic RP abnormalities including night blindness as the initial symptom, retinal bone-spicule pigmentation and attenuated retinal vessels, constriction of visual fields, and a nonrecordable ERG or ERG responses in a rod-cone pattern. Two unrelated patients had posterior subcapsular cataracts. The authors observed differences in the photoreceptor dystrophy between the families: in 1 patient from family A, the cones were more severely affected than the rods (cone-rod pattern) and kinetic visual fields were not constricted but showed bilateral central scotomas; fundus examination revealed central abnormalities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium and moderate attenuation of retinal vessels. Her 60-year-old brother also had central fundus lesions, but his ERG showed neither rod nor cone activity. Family B had relatively late onset of a classic form of RP, with preservation of central vision. The proband in family C, who was the youngest patient in the study, was the only one who was legally blind, due to severely constricted visual fields.



SLC9A3
**Diarrhea 8, secretory sodium, congenital, 616868 (3), AR**
Holmberg and Perheentupa (1985) described a 9-year-old Finnish girl with congenital diarrhea that seemed to be caused by a specific defect in intestinal sodium absorption. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal polyhydramnios, and in the delivery room the patient had a distended abdomen and passed a voluminous watery stool, indicative of intrauterine onset of the diarrhea. Stool analysis showed an abnormally high chloride level, but an even higher sodium concentration. Administration of standard solutions used to treat congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD; see 214700) resulted in metabolic acidosis and vomiting, with an electrolyte status clearly different than that seen in infants with CCD. She improved after treatment with an alkalinizing sodium and potassium citrate solution, and had normal growth and development despite persistent watery diarrhea of more than 1 liter per day that did not cease on fasting. X-rays of the stomach and intestines were normal except for slight dilation of the ileal loops.
Janecke et al. (2015) reported 9 patients from 8 families with secretory sodium diarrhea. There was maternal polyhydramnios in all pregnancies, and all patients had watery secretory diarrhea and prominent abdominal distention after birth due to dilated fluid-filled loops of intestine, indicating that secretory diarrhea had begun prenatally. None of the patients exhibited syndromic features. Inflammatory bowel disease developed in 2 patients, with onset at 4 years of age in 1 patient, resulting in ileocecal resection and temporary ileostomy due to recurrent episodes of small bowel obstruction. The second patient presented at age 16 years with bloody diarrhea and ulceration in the rectum and sigmoid; 1 year later he had nodular lymphoid hyperplasia with ileal granulomas and colonic ulcers, and he passed 3 to 4 watery stools per day without bleeding. Intestinal anatomy, histology, and transit functions were normal in the other patients.
Dimitrov et al. (2019) reported 1-year-old male with a prenatal history of polyhydramnios and dilation of the small intestine seen on ultrasound at 31 weeks' gestation. Digestive enzymes in the amniotic fluid, including gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase, lipase, and total alkaline phosphatase, were elevated. He had diarrhea starting on the first day of life and a distended abdomen. He had hyponatremia, low bicarbonate, undetectable urinary sodium, and a fecal sodium of 99 mmol/l. He was treated with sodium and bicarbonate supplementation and oral rehydration. At 6 months of age, he had normal growth and normal neurologic development.
Gupta et al. (2019) reported a 16-month-old girl with a prenatal history of polyhydramnios and dilated bowel loops on ultrasound at 14 weeks' gestation. She had increased stool output starting on the first day of life, and an elevated fecal sodium on laboratory testing. A gastrostomy tube was placed for fluid and electrolyte management. At 16 months of age, the patient had infrequent diarrhea and continued to require electrolyte replacement. Growth was normal.



HPSE2
**Urofacial syndrome 1, 236730 (3), AR**
The urofacial syndrome (UFS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by a severe and early-onset form of dysfunctional urinary voiding. Affected individuals usually present prenatally or in early childhood with grossly distorted renal tracts, comprising dysmorphic bladders and dilatation of the ureter and renal pelvis. They are at high risk of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), with ascending bacterial infection leading to kidney damage, hypertension, and renal failure. One-third of UFS children also experience constipation or fecal soiling, suggesting that the pathophysiology of the syndrome encompasses a broader functional impairment of elimination. In addition, affected individuals have a characteristic facial grimace when trying to smile (summary by Daly et al., 2010).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Urofacial Syndrome
Urofacial syndrome-2 (UFS2; 615112) is caused by mutation in the LRIG2 gene (608869) on chromosome 1p13.
In 3 unrelated families Elejalde (1979) observed 7 children with hydronephrosis, hydroureter and a peculiar facial expression, mainly when smiling or crying. Urethral valves, as well as urethral obstruction, were demonstrated in some. All 3 males had cryptorchidism. One instance of first-cousin parents suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. However, Elejalde (1979) favored autosomal dominant inheritance because the paternal grandfather in that instance was said to have had the same facies and 2 grandsons by another son had the full syndrome and because the proportion of affected sibs was 7 of 13 (closer to 50% than 25%). The last is not a compelling argument. Elejalde (1979) called the disorder the Ochoa syndrome and thanked Dr. Bernardo Ochoa for referring the patients for study. Ochoa and Gorlin (1987) stated that between 1965 and 1986 they saw 36 children with enuresis and urinary tract infection in association with 'inversion' of facial expression when laughing. Mild neuropathic bladder was demonstrated in all cases, with severe urinary tract damage in most. About two-thirds of the patients had moderate to severe constipation. The occurrence of the disorder in multiple sibs with normal parents and increased consanguinity, as well as an equal distribution according to sex, support autosomal recessive inheritance.
Teebi et al. (1989) described a case in a Arab child with consanguineous parents. The patient had early urologic evaluation because he showed the characteristic 'inverted' facial expression, i.e., when smiling or laughing, he appeared to be crying. Investigations at age 6 showed minor changes, indicating the probable importance of detecting the abnormality through the facial expression at an early age.
Garcia-Minaur et al. (2001) described a Spanish boy and 2 Irish sisters with urofacial syndrome. The 12-year-old boy, who was born of consanguineous parents, presented at 3 years of age with a urinary tract infection, and ultrasonography revealed an enlarged left kidney with ureteral, pelvic, and calyceal dilation; voiding cystourethrography showed a trabeculated bladder with narrowing of the urethra and 'massive' left vesicoureteral reflux. Sphincter electromyography at 9 years of age showed severe lack of coordination between detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation, with significant residual urine after voiding. Other features included a slow growth rate, with height and weight in the 3rd centile, a tendency to constipation, and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (see 194200). He did not have cryptorchidism. His father was reported to have multiple urinary tract infections but urologic investigations were normal and he did not show the characteristic grimace. In the Irish family, 1 sister was the offspring of a twin pregnancy; her twin brother died in the neonatal period of unclear causes. She had constipation and several urinary tract infections in the first years of life, and evaluation at 3 years of age showed unusual facial grimacing and a grossly trabeculated bladder on cystoscopy. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) showed gross dilation of the left collecting system and a nonfunctioning left kidney, with some evidence of right hydronephrosis and hydroureter. She underwent multiple urologic surgeries, and at the time of the report had a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR; 40 ml/min) and was maintained on self-catheterization and prophylactic antibiotics. She had normal external ocular movements but bilateral weakness in the distribution of the seventh cranial nerve. Her asymptomatic sister, who had been noted to have similar facial movements, was diagnosed at age 25 years: she had had several urinary tract infections which responded to antibiotic treatment, urea and creatinine serum levels were normal, and IVP showed some clubbing of the upper pole of the right kidney. Cranial nerve examination was normal.
Derbent et al. (2009) studied a 16-year-old Turkish girl, born of first-cousin parents, with recurrent urinary tract infections and persistent enuresis in childhood who at 10 years of age was found to have moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and a trabeculated bladder with urinary retention, and underwent surgery for vesicoureteral reflux. Upon evaluation at 16 years of age, the patient showed the characteristic 'inverted' facial expression of UFS upon attempting to smile, and ultrasonography revealed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis with postvoiding dilation of the renal pelvises and bladder. Her glomerular filtration rate was within normal limits, as were routine biochemistry results, including urea and creatinine levels. Examination and electromyography of facial nerves were normal. Derbent et al. (2009) stated that this was the first UFS case reported from Turkey.
Aydogdu et al. (2010) described 10 Turkish patients from 4 families and 1 sporadic patient with UFS. In 1 family, 2 male cousins were affected, 1 of whom displayed only the characteristic facial grimace when attempting to smile, but had no symptoms of elimination dysfunction and showed normal findings on ultrasound, dimarcaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, uroflowmetry, and videourodynamics. In another family in which 2 male cousins were affected, 1 of them had no facial abnormalities but a history of febrile urinary tract infections since birth with severe incontinence, a low-capacity bladder, and bilateral grade 3 reflux.
Daly et al. (2010) reported 3 British Pakistani sibs with urofacial syndrome, born of unaffected first-cousin parents. The proband presented at 2 years of age in acute renal failure with urinary sepsis and was found to have a hypercontractile bladder, bilateral vesicoureteral reflux, and hydronephrotic scarred kidneys; he underwent a surgical ileal loop urinary diversion procedure. At 11 years of age, he had a low-normal glomerular filtration rate with mild proteinuria, and required treatment for hypertension. At age 6, his sister was found to have dysfunctional voiding with a hypocontractile bladder and VUR; she did not have surgery and her kidney function remained normal. A younger brother presented with renal pelvis dilation on antenatal ultrasound, and postnatally was found to have a low-capacity trabeculated bladder with VUR; he underwent surgical urinary diversion, and at age 10 years he had a low-normal GFR and mild proteinuria but was normotensive. All 3 sibs had the characteristic UFS grimace upon smiling.



DLC1
**Colorectal cancer, somatic, 114500 (3)**
Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease that is common in both men and women. In addition to lifestyle and environmental risk factors, gene defects can contribute to an inherited predisposition to CRC. CRC is caused by changes in different molecular pathogenic pathways, such as chromosomal instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. Chromosome instability is the most common alteration and is present in almost 85% of all cases (review by Schweiger et al., 2013).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Colorectal Cancer
Mutations in a single gene result in a marked predisposition to colorectal cancer in 2 distinct syndromes: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 175100) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; see 120435). FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene (611731), whereas HNPCC is caused by mutations in several genes, including MSH2 (609309), MLH1 (120436), PMS1 (600258), PMS2 (600259), MSH6 (600678), TGFBR2 (190182), and MLH3 (604395). Epigenetic silencing of MSH2 results in a form of HNPCC (see HNPCC8, 613244). Other colorectal cancer syndromes include autosomal recessive adenomatous polyposis (608456), which is caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene (604933), and oligodontia-colorectal cancer syndrome (608615), which is caused by mutations in the AXIN2 gene (604025).
The CHEK2 gene (604373) has been implicated in susceptibility to colorectal cancer in Finnish patients. A germline mutation in the PLA2G2A gene (172411) was identified in a patient with colorectal cancer.
Germline susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer have also been identified. CRCS1 (608812) is conferred by mutation in the GALNT12 gene (610290) on chromosome 9q22; CRCS2 (611469) maps to chromosome 8q24; CRCS3 (612229) is conferred by variation in the SMAD7 gene (602932) on chromosome 18; CRCS4 (601228) is conferred by variation on 15q that causes increased and ectopic expression of the GREM1 gene (603054); CRCS5 (612230) maps to chromosome 10p14; CRCS6 (612231) maps to chromosome 8q23; CRCS7 (612232) maps to chromosome 11q23; CRCS8 (612589) maps to chromosome 14q22; CRCS9 (612590) maps to 16q22; CRCS10 (612591) is conferred by mutation in the POLD1 gene (174761) on chromosome 19q13; CRCS11 (612592) maps to chromosome 20p12; and CRCS12 (615083) is conferred by mutation in the POLE gene (174762) on chromosome 12q24.
Somatic mutations in many different genes, including KRAS (190070), PIK3CA (171834), BRAF (164757), CTNNB1 (116806), FGFR3 (134934), AXIN2 (604025), AKT1 (164730), MCC (159350), MYH11 (160745), PARK2 (602544), RNF43 (612482), and BUB1 (601452) have been identified in colorectal cancer.
Colon cancer is a well-known feature of familial polyposis coli. Cancer of the colon occurred in 7 members of 4 successive generations of the family reported by Kluge (1964), leading him to suggest a simple genetic basis for colonic cancer independent of polyposis. The combination of colonic and endometrial cancer has been observed in many families (e.g., Williams, 1978).
Sivak et al. (1981) studied a kindred with the familial cancer syndrome in which every confirmed affected member had at least 1 primary carcinoma of the colon. The average age at which cancer appeared was 38 years. Multiple primary neoplasms occurred in 23% of cancer patients.
Budd and Fink (1981) reported a family with a high frequency of mucoid colonic carcinoma. Since endometrial carcinoma, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, uterine leiomyosarcoma, bladder transitional carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma also occurred in the family, this may be the same disorder as the Lynch cancer family syndrome type II (120435).
Bamezai et al. (1984) reported an Indian Sikh kindred in which 8 persons suffered from cancer of the cecum, not associated with polyposis.
Burt et al. (1985) studied a large Utah kindred called to attention because of occurrence of colorectal cancer in a brother, a sister, and a nephew. No clear inheritance pattern was discernible until systematic screening was undertaken for colonic polyps using flexible proctosigmoidoscopy. One or more adenomatous polyps were found in 41 of 191 family members (21%) and 12 of 132 controls (9%)--p less than 0.005. Pedigree analysis showed best fit with autosomal dominant inheritance. Cannon-Albright et al. (1988) extended the studies with investigations of 33 additional kindreds. The kindreds were selected through either a single person with an adenomatous polyp or a cluster of relatives with colonic cancer. The kindreds all had common colorectal cancers, not the rare inherited condition of familial polyposis coli or nonpolyposis inherited colorectal cancer. Likelihood analysis strongly supported dominant inheritance of a susceptibility to colorectal adenomas and cancers, with a gene frequency of 19%. According to the most likely genetic model, adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancers occur only in genetically susceptible persons; however, the 95% confidence interval for this proportion was 53 to 100%.
Ponz de Leon et al. (1992) analyzed data on 605 families of probands with colorectal cancer in the province of Modena in Italy. Among the 577 presumed nonpolyposis cases, both parents had colorectal cancer in 11, one parent in 130, and neither parent in 436. Segregation was compatible with dominant transmission of susceptibility to cancer.
Mecklin (1987) investigated the frequency of hereditary colorectal cancer among all colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in 1 Finnish county during the 1970s. The cancer family syndrome type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma emerged as the most common verifiable risk factor, involving between 3.8 and 5.5% of all colorectal cancer patients. The frequencies of familial adenomatosis and ulcerative colitis were 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The observed frequency is probably an underestimate. The patients with cancer family syndrome were young, accounting for 29 to 39% of the patients under 50 years of age, and their tumors were located predominantly (65%) in the right hemicolon.



PDE6B
**Night blindness, congenital stationary, autosomal dominant 2, 163500 (3), AD**
Rambusch (1909) described a large Danish kindred with autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). The ancestor of the family was a farmer born about 1660 in northern Jutland. At the time of the report by Rosenberg et al. (1991), the pedigree comprised more than 200 affected persons in 11 generations. Gal et al. (1994) summarized the findings. Autosomal dominant inheritance was substantiated by several instances of male-to-male transmission. Penetrance was complete. Expression of the mutant allele seemed to be uniform; affected members complained of lack of night vision for as long as they could remember. Ophthalmoscopy revealed no signs of retinitis pigmentosa (see 268000). Dark adaptation curves were monophasic, due to the absence of the rod phase, with final thresholds elevated approximately by a factor of 10(3). Day vision was normal in all patients. Rod responses following full-field single-flash stimulation with a dim blue light were absent, while mixed cone-rod responses to white suprathreshold stimuli were strongly attenuated. The residual b-wave had a shape and temporal characteristics of a cone response with superimposed oscillatory potentials. The a-wave amplitude was reduced to 30 to 50% of the lower normal limit, while implicit time was normal. Cone responses to 32-Hz flickering white light were normal. Both electrophysiologic and psychophysical findings in affected family members were identical to those reported in patients from the Nougaret family (see 610444), in whom mutations in the GNAT1 gene (139330) were found.
Tsang et al. (2007) reported a 36-year-old man with a long history of CSNB and myopia. ERG showed generalized retinal dysfunction affecting the rod system and a locus of dysfunction at the rod-bipolar interface. There was little change in 10 years and no evidence of photoreceptor cell death. There was a family history of the disorder; genetic analysis identified a mutation in the PDE6B gene (H258N; 180072.0005).
**Retinitis pigmentosa-40, 613801 (3), AR**
McLaughlin et al. (1993) identified 6 patients from 3 families with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and mutations in the PDE6B gene. All affected individuals had clinical findings typical of RP. They reported absent night vision from early childhood. Ophthalmoscopy revealed attenuated retinal vessels and typical intraretinal bone spicule pigment around the midperiphery.
Among 19 Spanish families with autosomal recessive RP, Bayes et al. (1995) identified 1 carrying a homozygous mutation in PDE6B (RP40). The proband was a 39-year-old man who reported absence of night vision since childhood. Ophthalmoscopy revealed a pale retina, attenuated retinal vessels, and typical intraretinal bone spicule pigment in the midperiphery and around the periphery. There was no detectable rod or cone response on ERG.
Hmani-Aifa et al. (2009) studied a consanguineous Tunisian family in which autosomal recessive RP cosegregated with Usher syndrome (USH2C; 605472). The family had been originally reported by Hmani et al. (1999).



RHCE
**Rh-null disease, amorph type, 617970 (3)**
The RH-null phenotype designates rare individuals whose red blood cells lack all Rh antigens. Two RH-null types, the regulator type (268150) and the amorph type, arising from independent genetic mechanisms have been distinguished. The regulator type is caused by mutation in the RHAG gene (180297). The amorph type arises from mutations at the RH locus itself that silence Rh expression. The RH locus contains the RHD (111680) and RHCE genes tandemly arranged at chromosome 1p36-p34. Four genes must therefore be silenced to produce the RH-null phenotype. The absence of the D antigen, produced by the RHD gene, is common in the human population; the D-negative phenotype may result from deletion or genetic alteration of the RHD gene. The RH-null amorph phenotype thus arises from inactivating mutations in RHCE on a D-negative background (summary by Huang et al., 1998, Huang et al., 2000).
Clinically, Rh-null patients present mild to moderate hemolytic anemia; cells exhibit characteristic morphologic and functional abnormalities including spherocytosis, stomatocytosis, and diminished lifespan. Rh-null patients rarely develop antibodies without stimulation, and most cases occur in response to pregnancy or transfusion (Silvy et al., 2015).
Seidl et al. (1972) reported 2 German sibs from a consanguineous family in whom Rh determination revealed complete lack of all Rh antigens. In the female sib, hemolytic anemia was detected during hospitalization for bronchopneumonia; a splenectomy was performed because of suspicion of a hereditary spherocytosis. Both she and her male sib reported several periods of jaundice which they attributed to stress situations (e.g., appendectomy, university graduation, business problems). These patients were later analyzed molecularly by Huang et al. (1998) and Cherif-Zahar et al. (1998).
In a survey of 42 examples of the Rh-null phenotype, Nash and Shojania (1987) found that only 5 were of the amorph type.
Perez-Perez et al. (1992) described a Spanish family in which a silent Rh gene was segregating, giving rise to the amorph type of Rh-null in the proposita whose parents were first cousins. She suffered from severe hemolytic anemia. Western blot analysis carried out with glycosylation-independent antibodies directed against the Rh polypeptide and the LW glycoprotein, respectively, confirmed that these protein components were absent from the red cells of the proposita.
Silvy et al. (2015) studied a 32-year-old pregnant woman from Libya with moderate hemolytic anemia and a history of 5 pregnancies with varying degrees of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). The fourth pregnancy resulted in stillbirth and the fifth fetus died in utero at 32 weeks' gestation despite a normal ultrasound at 30 weeks. Rh phenotyping revealed that her red blood cells lacked all common Rh antigens.



ITPR2
**?Anhidrosis, isolated, with normal sweat glands, 106190 (3), AR**
Isolated anhidrosis with normal sweat glands (ANHD) is characterized by absence of perspiration and subsequent heat intolerance with normal morphology and number of sweat glands. Teeth, hair, nails, and skin are normal (Klar et al., 2014).
Dann et al. (1990) reported the case of a young man with generalized anhidrosis rendering him heat intolerant. His reaction to muscarinic stimulation of sweat glands was 10% of normal. On biopsy, the sweat glands were morphologically intact and cardiovascular autonomic responses were normal. The patient's mother reported reduced sweating and her response to muscarinic stimulation was 50% of normal, but the father and 2 sisters sweated normally. A postganglionic defect was postulated. The sketchy information on the family is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance but also with X-linked inheritance since the deficiency in the mother appears to have been less severe than that in the son. Ingber (1990) suggested that the disorder described by Dann et al. (1990) be named Dann-Epstein-Sohar syndrome.
Klar et al. (2014) described a consanguineous Pakistani family in which 5 members had anhidrosis and severe heat intolerance, confirmed by starch-iodine sweat test. Body growth, teeth, hair, nails, and skin were normal. Affected family members did not report dry mouth, reduced saliva production, or malabsorption. Biochemical analysis of serum and urine in 2 affected individuals showed electrolyte levels within normal ranges; S-amylase levels were also normal. Skin biopsy from the forearm of 1 affected family member showed normal morphology and a normal number of eccrine sweat glands.
Classification
Ingber (1990) commented that there are 3 types of generalized anhidrosis: (1) ectodermal dysplasia with generalized anhidrosis, and hair, sweat gland and dental anomalies with or without additional congenital defects (see 305100); (2) ectodermal dysplasia with generalized anhidrosis, with no other defects but with morphologic and functional abnormalities of sweat glands (see 206600); and (3) ectodermal dysplasia with generalized anhidrosis, with no other defects and with no morphologic sweat gland anomalies.

**Leukemia, acute lymphocytic, somatic, 613065 (3)**
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), also known as acute lymphocytic leukemia, is a subtype of acute leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells. Somatically acquired mutations in several genes have been identified in ALL lymphoblasts, cells in the early stages of differentiation. Germline variation in certain genes may also predispose to susceptibility to ALL (Trevino et al., 2009).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
A susceptibility locus for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL1) has been mapped to chromosome 10q21. See also ALL2 (613067), which has been mapped to chromosome 7p12.2; and ALL3 (615545), which is caused by mutation in the PAX5 gene (167414) on chromosome 9p.
**Leukemia, chronic myeloid, somatic, 608232 (3)**
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell with a specific cytogenetic abnormality, the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), involving myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, B lymphoid, and sometimes T lymphoid cells, but not marrow fibroblasts. Silver (2003) reviewed the hematologic and clinical aspects of chronic myeloid leukemia. Geary (2000) presented a historical review of CML.
CML has a biphase or triphase clinical course (Medina et al., 2003). Approximately 90% of patients are diagnosed in the chronic phase, but the disease eventually evolves to a blastic phase unless successfully treated. Approximately two-thirds of patients manifest an accelerated phase. A distinct feature of disease progression is the appearance of additional cytogenetic abnormalities in the Ph-positive cells. This phenomenon, known as clonal evolution, frequently involves a second Ph, trisomy of chromosome 8, and isochromosome 17 and other abnormalities of chromosome 17 (Kantarjian et al., 1988), although other abnormalities have been described. Clonal evolution is considered a criterion of accelerated phase, although when it represents the only criterion of transformation, it is associated with a better prognosis than other criteria of accelerated phase (Cortes et al., 2003).
Sawyers (1999) reviewed the clinical aspects of chronic myeloid leukemia.



LMF1
**Lipase deficiency, combined, 246650 (3), AR**
Auwerx et al. (1990) described a large family with familial hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL; 151670) deficiency and a coexisting reduced lipoprotein lipase (LPL; 609708) similar to the heterozygous state of LPL deficiency. The proband was detected because of hypertriglyceridemia and chylomicronemia. Analysis of genomic DNA from these subjects by restriction enzyme digestion showed no major abnormalities in the structure of either the HTGL gene or the LPL gene. The authors incorrectly referred to 'compound heterozygotes for HTGL and LPL deficiency'; they should have referred to these individuals as 'double heterozygotes,' because the genes represent separate loci on separate chromosomes (chromosome 15 and chromosome 8, respectively).
The hypertriglyceridemia in the cld mouse (see Animal Model) is characterized by severe chylomicronemia that is caused by deficiency of lipoprotein lipase and exacerbated by partial deficiency of hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL; 151670). The mutation, however, affects neither the LPL nor the HTGL gene, but a transmembrane protein designated Lmf1 by Peterfy et al. (2007). To investigate the potential role of the LMF1 gene in human disease, Peterfy et al. (2007) screened 11 individuals with hypertriglyceridemia and decreased lipase activity for mutations. They identified a 48-year-old woman carrying an LMF1 mutation in homozygosity in whom severe hypertriglyceridemia was first noted at age 18 years. She had her first attack of pancreatitis at age 27, and had had at least 15 subsequent attacks. She began to develop lipodystrophy at age 44 that progressed to complete involvement of limbs and buttocks, sparing her face and abdomen. Also at age 44, type 2 diabetes was diagnosed, which was controlled with metformin. Bilateral large tuberous xanthomas on elbows, knees, and feet were present. Even in compliance with strict dietary fat restrictions, triglyceride concentration was 7 times the average of 31 control subjects at the lowest measurement, and increased markedly to over 70 times the control value when diet was not regulated. The severe hypertriglyceridemia was found to be due to LPL deficiency, as determined by a 93% decrease in LPL activity in the plasma of the affected individual. In addition, hepatic lipase activity was decreased by half, confirming the status of combined lipase deficiency.
Cefalu et al. (2009) screened 22 individuals with severe hypertriglyceridemia and identified 1 with a homozygous mutation in the LMF1 gene. The proband was a 42-year-old Tunisian man living in Sicily, Italy. His parents were apparently unrelated. His mother died at age 62 years of a respiratory disease; the 65-year-old father and his 7 sibs were all healthy. Severe hypertriglyceridemia was first noted at age 32 years when the patient had an episode of acute pancreatitis. A diet restriction to 15% of fat intake (less than 7% of saturated fat) and treatment with fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids were prescribed, but compliance was poor, and the patient had a second episode of pancreatitis at age 38 years. He was overweight, with a BMI of 29. Triglycerides were 2,400 mg/dL, total cholesterol was 374 mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol levels were 44 mg/dL. He had a third episode of acute pancreatitis at age 41 years and then developed type 2 diabetes.



SMAD1
**Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2D, 601472 (3), AD**
Ionasescu et al. (1996) reported results of clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic linkage studies on a large pedigree with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth axonal neuropathy type 2, which they designated CMT2D. The pedigree consisted of 38 members, 14 of which were affected. Onset of the disease was between 16 and 30 years of age with weakness of the hands. Affected members had severe weakness and atrophy of the hands and mild to moderate weakness of the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in the upper extremities and decreased in the lower extremities. There was distal hypesthesia for touch, proprioception, and vibration sense. Variable pes cavus and hammertoes were present in all patients. Mild to moderate balance impairment was present in 5 patients with a positive Romberg sign. Gowers and Trendelenburg signs were present in 2 patients. Scoliosis was present in 4 patients. The disease had a mild progressive course in 12 patients. No nerve enlargement, no tremors, no paralysis of the vocal cord or diaphragm, and no abnormalities of cranial nerve function were detected. Motor nerve conduction velocities showed normal values with normal latencies. Electromyographs revealed signs of denervation with large motor unit potentials, fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves. Ionasescu et al. (1996) reported that the absence of palpably enlarged nerves distinguished this pedigree from cases of CMT1. The clinical picture in this pedigree was different from other axonal CMT2 types in that weakness and atrophy were more severe in the hands than in the feet, and that sensory impairment had the same prevalence as the motor involvement.
Sambuughin et al. (1998) reported a family in which autosomal dominant CMT2D and a form of distal spinal muscular atrophy (DSMAVA; 600794) segregated in the same kindred. All 17 affected members had bilateral weakness and wasting in thenar and first dorsal interossei muscles starting commonly with cold-induced cramps in the hands in their late teens. The mean age at onset was 18 years (range 12 to 36) and progression of illness was very slow. DSMAV was diagnosed in 11 patients based on the presence of hand and peroneal muscle weakness and atrophy without sensory deficits. CMT2D was diagnosed in 6 other patients based on the presence of weakness and atrophy in the same muscle groups, hypoactive knee and ankle reflexes, stocking and glove distribution sensory loss, and reduced sensory nerve action potential amplitudes.
Yalcouye et al. (2019) reported 2 Malian sibs, aged 19 and 35 years, with CMT2D. Symptoms in both started at 12 years of age with upper extremity muscle weakness and progressed to involve the thenar and interosseous muscles and then the lower extremities. On examination, both sibs had distal muscle weakness and atrophy with sensory loss, which was more pronounced in the upper than the lower extremities. They both had decreased or absent reflexes and a steppage gait. The older sib had clawhands. Both sibs had recurrent seizures beginning at approximately 12 years of age, and an EEG showed slow frontal temporal waves in the older sib. Nerve conduction studies revealed no response in any nerves tested, including the left peroneal, sural, median and tibial nerves.
**Neuropathy, distal hereditary motor, type VA, 600794 (3), AD**
Meadows and Marsden (1969) reported 3 sibs with a form of distal muscular atrophy confined largely to the upper extremities. All had weakness of the hands since early childhood, manifest by difficulty writing. The condition worsened significantly much later in life, in the sixth and seventh decades. Hand weakness and atrophy were apparent in all, and 2 sibs had lower limb weakness with hyporeflexia/areflexia; the remaining sib had hyporeflexia/areflexia without lower limb weakness. EMG and muscle biopsy confirmed a neurogenic disorder. The mode of inheritance was unclear.
Christodoulou et al. (1995) identified a large 5-generation Bulgarian family from Burgass with an autosomal dominant distal spinal muscular atrophy (dSMA) with upper limb predominance. Afflicted members had weakness and wasting which was more prominent in the upper limbs and more selectively involved the thenar muscles and the first dorsal interossei. They had clinical information on 114 family members, of whom 30 were affected. The disease commenced with hand involvement at a mean age of 17 years (median 16 years). In 40% of patients, symptoms subsequently developed in their feet within about 2 years. In 1 branch of the family, mild pyramidal features and, rarely, up-going plantar responses were observed. There were not sensory symptoms or signs except for slightly reduced vibratory sense in the feet in 10% of the patients. Progression of the disease was very slow, with patients still ambulant at the age of 64. Electrophysiologic investigations showed reduced or, in severely wasted muscles, unobtainable compound motor action potentials. Motor conduction velocities and distal latencies were normal, except in severely wasted muscles, where the former were reduced. Christodoulou et al. (1995) concluded that the family fell into the type V category of distal spinal muscular atrophy according to Harding (1993), who proposed a classification into 7 types of distal SMA according to their clinical and genetic features. The family was similar to the one reported by Lander et al. (1976), but differed in that weakness and wasting were more severe in the thenar muscles and first dorsal interossei. The family was considered to be different from the families with Silver syndrome described by Silver (1966) and by van Gent et al. (1985) in that most of their patients also had brisk reflexes and signs of spasticity in addition to hand weakness.
Sambuughin et al. (1998) reported a family in which autosomal dominant CMT2D and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V segregated in the same kindred. All 17 affected members had bilateral weakness and wasting in thenar and first dorsal interossei muscles starting commonly with cold-induced cramps in the hands in their late teens. The mean age at onset was 18 years (range 12 to 36) and progression of illness was very slow. DSMAV was diagnosed in 11 patients based on the presence of hand and peroneal muscle weakness and atrophy without sensory deficits. CMT2D was diagnosed in 6 other patients based on the presence of weakness and atrophy in the same muscle groups, hypoactive knee and ankle reflexes, stocking and glove distribution sensory loss, and reduced sensory nerve action potential amplitudes.
Antonellis et al. (2003) reported an Algerian Sephardic Jewish family with autosomal dominant DSMAV. A father and daughter had bilateral hand amyotrophy and weakness, particularly in the thenar and dorsal interosseus muscles. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were normal.
Van de Warrenburg et al. (2006) reported 2 unrelated Dutch families with overlapping Silver syndrome and distal motor neuropathy caused by the same BSCL2 mutation (N88S; 606158.0013). The first family contained 5 affected individuals spanning 3 generations. All presented with pes cavus and foot of leg muscle weakness and atrophy between 11 and 26 years of age. There was slow progression, with gradually evolving lower limb hypertonia and hyperreflexia with extensor plantar responses without prominent spasticity. Two patients also developed weakness and atrophy of the first dorsal interosseus and abductor pollicis brevis muscles without involvement of the hypothenar muscles. In the second family, there were multiple affected individuals spanning 3 generations. Age at onset was before age 20 years. About half of the patients presented with foot or leg muscle weakness and atrophy, whereas the other half presented with hand muscle weakness and atrophy. Most developed hyperreflexia with extensor plantar responses; spasticity was observed in older patients. Van de Warrenburg et al. (2006) emphasized the phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance of some symptoms.
Brusse et al. (2009) reported 12 members of a large 3-generation Dutch family with phenotypic overlap between Silver syndrome and distal HMN5 who carried a heterozygous N88S mutation in the BSCL2 gene. The phenotype was variable, and the distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy included predominantly the feet (in 4), the hands (in 1), or both upper and lower extremities (in 4). Three individuals showed evidence of pyramidal features, including spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses. Severity of the disease ranged from adolescent patients with disabling muscle weakness to an elderly patient with only mild weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors and bilateral pes cavus. Brusse et al. (2009) noted the extreme phenotypic variability associated with the N88S mutation in their family and in those reported by Auer-Grumbach et al. (2005) and van de Warrenburg et al. (2006), who also carried the N88S mutation, and suggested the presence of other genetic or environmental factors. In their family, Brusse et al. (2009) used genomewide linkage analysis to identify a candidate disease modifier on chromosome 16p13.3-p13.12 that was shared by all 12 affected individuals (maximum lod score of 3.28). One family member without the N88S mutation but with the chromosome 16p haplotype showed mild electrophysiologic abnormalities. Brusse et al. (2009) postulated that a locus on chromosome 16p may contain a disease modifier in their family.



CFHR3
**{Hemolytic uremic syndrome, atypical, susceptibility to}, 235400 (3), AR, AD**
Typical hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia associated with distorted erythrocytes ('burr cells'). The vast majority of cases (90%) are sporadic, occur in children under 3 years of age, and are associated with epidemics of diarrhea caused by verotoxin-producing E. coli. The death rate is very low, about 30% of cases have renal sequelae, and there is usually no relapse of the disease. This form of HUS usually presents with a diarrhea prodrome (thus referred to as D+HUS) and has a good prognosis in most cases. In contrast, a subgroup of patients with HUS have an atypical presentation (aHUS or D-HUS) without a prodrome of enterocolitis and diarrhea and have a much poorer prognosis, with a tendency to relapse and frequent development of end-stage renal failure or death. These cases tend to be familial. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported (Goodship et al., 1997; Taylor, 2001; Veyradier et al., 2003; Noris et al., 2003). Noris and Remuzzi (2009) provided a detailed review of atypical HUS.
Genetic Heterogeneity of Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
Atypical HUS is a genetically heterogeneous condition. Susceptibility to the development of the disorder can be conferred by mutations in various components of or regulatory factors in the complement cascade system (Jozsi et al., 2008). See AHUS2 (612922), AHUS3 (612923), AHUS4 (612924), AHUS5 (612925), and AHUS6 (612926). AHUS7 (see 615008) is caused by mutation in the DGKE gene (601440), which is not part of the complement cascade system.
Hagge et al. (1967) reported the hemolytic uremic syndrome in 2 sibs. Features included intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and azotemia. One had repeated attacks ending in renal failure and death at age 8 years; the other recovered completely after one attack. Chan et al. (1969) reported HUS in 2 adopted, unrelated sibs.
Kaplan et al. (1975) reported HUS in 3 sibs and reviewed reports of 21 sibships with 2 or more affected individuals. Two groups of families could be identified among 41 analyzed. Sibs whose onset was within a short time of each other had a relatively good prognosis (19% mortality). Those whose onset was more than a year apart had a poorer prognosis (68% mortality). Kaplan et al. (1975) suggested that an environmental agent was causative in the first group and that genetic factors were important in the second. Most of the first group of families came from an endemic area, whereas most of the second group came from a nonendemic area.
Blattler et al. (1975) studied a family in which 4 sibs had died from HUS. The parents and 4 surviving sibs had normal renal function and normal platelet and fibrinogen survival. The mother and 3 sibs had an increased percentage of megathrombocytes. Two of them showed renal accumulation of Cr 51-platelet radioactivity and ultrastructural changes of the endothelium on renal biopsy.
Edelsten and Tuck (1978) reported a family with HUS inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
Thompson and Winterborn (1981) reported an 8-month-old Asian boy with very low levels of plasma factor H who presented with the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Complement component C3 (120700) was also depleted. A healthy 3-year-old brother had the same complement profile, suggesting activation of the alternative complement pathway. The parents, who were first cousins, had half-normal levels of factor H.
Kirchner et al. (1982) described this disorder in mother and daughter. The daughter's illness, characterized primarily by renal insufficiency, was most compatible with adult hemolytic uremic syndrome and the mother's illness, with prominent neurologic findings, was most compatible with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Merrill et al. (1985) reported 2 certain cases and 3 possible case in 2 generations of a North Carolina black family.
Neuhaus et al. (1997) reported clinical features of atypical D-HUS in 23 children. Features included requirement for dialysis (74%), hypertension (43%), cardiomyopathy (43%), and cerebral convulsions (48%). Only 5 patients (26%), including 4 infants, recovered completely. Six patients (32%) had 1 to 10 recurrences and 8 (42%) developed end-stage renal failure. Four children died.
Warwicker et al. (1998) reported a 36-year-old man with sporadic relapsing aHUS. He had anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and acute renal failure. Renal biopsy showed a thrombotic microangiopathy and deposition of complement component C3 in vessel walls. He had half-normal serum levels of factor H and decreased levels of C3, consistent with activation of the alternative complement pathway. HUS recurred after renal transplantation. Molecular analysis revealed a heterozygous 4-bp deletion in the CFH gene (134370.0011).
Ohali et al. (1998) reported a large consanguineous Bedouin family in which 10 infants had atypical HUS characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, severe hypertension, edema, and increased serum triglycerides. All had very early onset with a median presentation at age 2 weeks. Two patients died during the first disease episode; the remaining 8 patients had a mean number of 4 relapses despite treatment. In total, 8 patients died at ages 3 weeks to 10 months. Factor H levels were low to undetectable in all 4 patients studied, and C3 levels were decreased in 9 of 10 infants tested. Four kidney biopsies showed marked arteriolar changes, including stenosis, edema, and thickening of the intima. Glomerular changes included swelling of endothelial cells with microvillus transformation and proliferation of mesangial cells with increased matrix deposition in the mesangium. Other changes included fibrotic changes in glomeruli and the tubulointerstitium, as well as C3 deposition in capillary walls.
Rougier et al. (1998) reported 6 children with complement factor H deficiency and acute glomerular disease. Five of the 6 children presented with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Two of the children were from a consanguineous family from Turkey and exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by absence of the 150-kD form of factor H.
Noris et al. (2003) reported a 21-year-old woman and her affected brother. Disease onset in the sister (the proband) was at age 16 months, when she developed fever, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. At the time, renal function was normal. Thereafter she had 6 recurrences of thrombotic microangiopathy, all associated with deteriorating renal function. Treatment consisted of plasma exchange and infusions, steroids, and blood transfusions, which led to complete recovery of blood abnormalities and renal function. The last episode occurred at age 20 years and was characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, and severe impairment of renal function. Renal biopsy showed irreversible changes of chronic nephropathy with typical features of HUS, including diffuse narrowing/occlusion of vessels and severe glomerular ischemia. At the age of 21 years she was on chronic dialysis. The proband's brother had 2 episodes of HUS at age 9 years. Both were characterized by severe hemolytic anemia and acute renal insufficiency and resolved without plasma treatment, with no renal sequelae.
**{Macular degeneration, age-related, reduced risk of}, 603075 (3), AD**
Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a progressive degeneration of photoreceptors and underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the macula region of the retina. It is a highly prevalent disease and a major cause of blindness in the Western world. Drusen, pale excrescences of variable size, and other deposits accumulate below the RPE on the Bruch membrane; clinical and histopathologic investigations have shown that these extracellular deposits are the hallmark of early ARMD. As ARMD advances, areas of geographic atrophy of the RPE can cause visual loss, or choroidal neovascularization can occur to cause wet, or exudative, ARMD with accompanying central visual loss (summary by De et al., 2007).
Genetic Heterogeneity of Age-Related Macular Degeneration
ARMD2 (153800) is associated with mutation in the ABCR gene (601691) on chromosome 1p, and ARMD3 (608895) is caused by mutation in the FBLN5 gene (604580) on chromosome 14q31. Up to 50% of the attributable risk of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD4; 610698) appears to be explained by a polymorphism in the CFH gene (134370.0008). ARMD5 (613761) and ARMD6 (613757) are associated with mutation in the ERCC6 (609413) and RAX2 (610362) genes, respectively. ARMD7 (610149) and ARMD8 (613778), which both represent susceptibility linked to chromosome 10q26, are associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the HTRA1 (602194) and ARMS2 (611313) genes, respectively. ARMD9 (611378) is associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the C3 gene (120700). ARMD10 (611488) maps to chromosome 9q32 and may be associated with a polymorphism in the TLR4 gene (603030). ARMD11 (611953) is association with variation in the CST3 gene (604312); ARMD12 (613784) with variation in the CX3CR1 gene (601470); and ARMD13 (615439) with variation in the CFI gene (217030). ARMD14 (615489) is associated with variation in or near the C2 (613927) and CFB (138470) genes on chromosome 6p21. ARMD15 (615591) is associated with variation in the C9 gene (120940). There is evidence for a form of ARMD caused by mutation in the mitochondrial gene MTTL1 (590050).
A haplotype carrying deletion of the complement factor H-related genes CFHR1 (134371) and CFHR3 (605336) is also associated with reduced risk of ARMD.
Lotery and Trump (2007) reviewed the molecular biology of age-related macular degeneration and tabulated the genes associated with ARMD, including those with only positive findings versus genes for which conflicting results have been found.
Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of acquired visual impairment in the elderly and is estimated to affect at least 11 million individuals in the United States. U.S. studies showed that mild forms of ARMD occur in nearly 30% of those 75 years and older, and advanced forms occur in about 7% of people in this age group. Allikmets et al. (1997) noted that ARMD is divided clinically into 2 subtypes: 80% of patients have 'dry' ARMD, the hallmarks of which include 1 or more of the following: the presence of cellular debris (drusen) in or under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), irregularities in the pigmentation of the RPE, or geographic atrophy (GA). Twenty percent of patients have exudative or 'wet' ARMD characterized by serous detachment of the RPE or choroidal neovascularization (CNV), or both. Severe vision loss is associated most often with geographic atrophy or exudative disease.
Streiff and Babel (1963) described senile macular changes in an 80-year-old mother and her 50-year-old daughter. Because of the late onset of the abnormality, dominant inheritance is more likely, and affected members of successive generations are not likely to be observed. Braley (1966) stated that senile macular degeneration runs in families: 'Nearly every patient I have seen has had other members of the family similarly affected.' Visual disturbance without ophthalmoscopic findings may be present by age 50 and fundus changes become apparent only after age 70. Meyers and Zachary (1988) described a family in which 6 of 13 children had age-related macular degeneration; 2 of the affected sibs were identical twins in whom monozygosity was established (with 99.4% likelihood) by genetic tests.
Postel et al. (2005) compared the phenotype between 411 singleton and 125 multiplex probands with ARMD and found the clinical appearance and distribution of ARMD grades to be similar. There was no statistically significant difference in grade distribution between the 2 groups. Postel et al. (2005) concluded that singleton and multiplex ARMD data could be combined for consolidated genetic analyses.
Bok (2002) stated there was widespread agreement among ophthalmologists that numerous large drusen, when present in both eyes, represent a significant risk factor for the evolution of early ARMD into more advanced ARMD, with loss of central vision.
In a population-based cohort study, Klein et al. (2003) examined the relationship of 2 diseases associated with systemic inflammatory response, emphysema and gout, and selected markers of systemic inflammation with the 10-year incidence of age-related maculopathy. They found a modest relationship between both increased white blood cell count and emphysema and the increased 10-year incidence of lesions defining early and late age-related maculopathy.
Phipps et al. (2003) found that cone adaptational kinetics were affected early in age-related maculopathy, while the visual acuity was still good.
Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) is a neovascularization that begins in the retina and extends through the subretinal space, eventually communicating with choroidal neovascularization. It occurs in 10 to 15% of neovascular ARMD cases (Ghazi, 2002). It has a poor natural history and shows resistance to treatment with conventional laser photocoagulation (Yannuzzi et al., 2001).
Scholl et al. (2004) reported close agreement between the grading of stereoscopic color slides and digitized nonstereoscopic images. Digitized nonstereoscopic color images of the macula proved to be useful for grading age-related maculopathy (ARM) and ARMD.
In a review of epidemiologic data regarding the natural history of ARMD and its risk factors, Klein et al. (2004) found that large soft drusen associated with pigmentary abnormalities increased the risk of progression to advanced ARMD. Large soft drusen might fade over time. Advanced ARMD was more likely to be present in whites than in blacks, despite the similar prevalence of soft drusen in both groups. Neovascular ARMD was more frequent than geographic atrophy in most population-based studies in whites in America, Australia, and the Netherlands than in similar population-based studies in Iceland and Norway. After age and family history, there were few consistent relationships of risk factors to ARMD. Of these, the relationships of smoking, hypertension, and cataract surgery to advanced ARMD had been the most consistent.
Maruko et al. (2007) studied the clinical characteristics of 189 consecutive Japanese patients newly diagnosed with neovascular ARMD at one hospital and found that their features differed from those reported in white patients. In Japanese patients, there was a preponderance of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), male gender, unilaterality, and absence of drusen in the second eye, with the exception of RAP.
In a review on the association of cigarette smoking and ARMD, Thornton et al. (2005) found that the estimate of risk was about 2- to 3-fold higher in current smokers when compared with never smokers in 13 studies. They concluded that cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for ARMD.
Chakravarthy et al. (2007) examined the association between cigarette smoking and ARMD in 158 cases of ARMD (109 neovascular and 49 GA) in a European population. Current smokers had increased odds of neovascular ARMD or geographic atrophy, whereas for ex-smokers the odds were less. Compared with people with unilateral ARMD, those with bilateral ARMD were more likely to have a history of heavy smoking in the previous 25 years. The attributable fraction for ARMD due to smoking was 27%. Chakravarthy et al. (2007) concluded that their findings highlighted the need for increasing public awareness of the risks associated with smoking.
In a longitudinal study using the Blue Mountains Eye Study cohort in Australia, Tan et al. (2007) assessed the relationship between cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors, other than smoking, and risk of long-term incident ARMD. Increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was inversely related to incident late ARMD. Elevated total-HDL cholesterol ratio predicted late ARMD and geographic atrophy (GA). Diabetes predicted incident GA, but not neovascular ARMD. History of stroke predicted incident early ARMD and incident indistinct soft or reticular drusen. Neither pulse pressure, systolic or diastolic blood pressure reading, nor presence of hypertension at baseline was associated with incident ARMD. Tan et al. (2007) stated that their findings provided evidence of links between cardiovascular risk factors and ARMD but that further prospective evaluation of these relationships was warranted.
In a longitudinal study using the Blue Mountains Eye Study cohort, Tan et al. (2007) found that, after controlling for age, gender, and other confounding factors, statin users, compared with nonusers, had a reduced risk of developing indistinct soft drusen, the principal late ARMD precursor lesion.
Nolan et al. (2007) identified a relative lack of macular pigment as an independent risk factor for ARMD.
Pang et al. (2015) examined 230 eyes of 150 consecutive patients with neovascular AMD and 40 human donor eyes with a histopathologic diagnosis of neovascular AMD for layered, hyperreflective, subretinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) lines, known as the onion sign. Sixteen (7%) of the 230 eyes and 2 (5%) of the 40 donor eyes had onion signs on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). In all 16 eyes, the onion sign persisted in follow-up for up to 5 years, with fluctuations in the abundance of lines and association with intraretinal hyperreflective foci. Histologic analysis of the 2 donor eyes revealed that the hyperreflective lines correlated with clefts created by extraction of cholesterol crystals during tissue processing.
Joachim et al. (2015) reported the incidence and progression of ARMD over 15 years, beginning with 3,654 participants aged 49 years or older, and ending with 1,149 of the remaining participants, in the Blue Mountains Eye Study. The 15-year incidence was 22.7% for early ARMD and 6.8% for late ARMD; after adjusting for competing risks, early and late ARMD incidence was 15.1% and 4.1%, respectively. Women had a higher incidence of any ARMD compared with men. Risk of progression to late ARMD was strongly associated with severity of early ARMD lesions.
ARMD1
In a family studied by Klein et al. (1998), 10 members with ARMD showed the presence of large, soft, confluent drusen (see 126700) accompanied by varying degrees of RPE degeneration and/or geographic atrophy. Age at diagnosis of ARMD ranged from 54 to 77 years (average, 65 years). In the 8 affected patients with visual symptoms, onset was between age 52 and 75 years (average, 67 years). The clinical picture was described as 'a predominantly dry phenotype.'
Pras et al. (2015) studied a 3-generation Tunisian Jewish family in which 5 elderly sibs had advanced ARMD. All were first diagnosed in the seventh decade of life, and all experienced progression to severe vision impairment within 10 years. Funduscopy and optical coherence tomography showed a variety of pathology, including macular hemorrhage, large hard drusen, massive depigmentation and geographic atrophy of the RPE, and choroidal neovascularization with resultant juxtafoveal scarring. Fluorescein angiography displayed early hyperfluorescence due to the simultaneous occurrence of many large foci of 'window defect' RPE atrophy as well as 'starry sky' staining of basal laminar drusen extending peripherally. Of 9 asymptomatic offspring in the next generation of the family, 7 had normal macular appearance whereas 2 sisters, aged 39 and 48 years, exhibited altered foveal reflexes with hypopigmentation.



PROZ
**[Protein Z deficiency], 614024 (3)**
Protein Z serves as a cofactor for the downregulation of coagulation by forming a complex with the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI; 605271). Evidence also suggests that protein Z may promote the assembly of thrombin with phospholipid surfaces, thus enhancing coagulation. There is a wide variation of protein Z levels in human plasma, and studies have reported conflicting results of the clinical consequences of protein Z deficiency in humans. Most studies have reported an association between decreased protein Z levels and thrombosis, including stroke, venous thrombosis, and obstetric complications, although early reports suggested an association between protein Z deficiency and bleeding tendency (Kemkes-Matthes and Matthes, 1995). Overall, a role for protein Z in the pathogenesis of hemostatic disorders in humans is controversial and remains unclear (review by Broze, 2001 and Vasse, 2008).
Protein Z deficiency has been shown to exacerbate the thrombotic phenotype in patients with thrombophilia due to factor V Leiden (see 188055).
Reports of Bleeding Tendency
Kemkes-Matthes and Matthes (1995) examined 36 patients with bleeding tendency of unknown origin who were not under oral anticoagulant treatment and had normal liver synthesis function. The mean protein Z levels of patients with bleeding tendency was significantly diminished (52%) in comparison with the healthy control group. In 21 of the patients, they found lower protein Z levels than in the lowest protein Z level of the control group. Kemkes-Matthes and Matthes (1995) concluded that protein Z deficiency is a new type of bleeding tendency that cannot be detected by routine coagulation tests and could be the cause for the 'capillary fragility syndrome.' The latter disorder is characterized by positive Rumpel Leed tests and normal routine coagulation tests. At the time of this study, protein Z was believed to associate with and help localize thrombin at the phospholipid surface at sites of injury. However, it was later found that the main role of protein Z is to inhibit the coagulation cascade prior to the formation of the prothrombinase complex (Vasse, 2008).
In contrast to the study of Kemkes-Matthes and Matthes (1995), Gamba et al. (1998) found no difference in plasma levels of protein Z between healthy controls and 15 adult patients with mild to moderate bleeding tendencies of unknown origin. These authors concluded that protein Z deficiency did not play a pathogenetic role in the bleeding tendency of their patients, and noted that the clinical impact of protein Z on hemostasis remained obscure.
Ravi et al. (1998) found a wide range of protein Z levels in healthy men and women, although women tended to have lower levels. None of 48 patients with a suspected bleeding disorder had a protein Z level below the normal range, but protein Z levels were significantly lower in the group of male patients with a bleeding history as compared to healthy men. The data indicated that low-normal protein Z levels are not associated with a bleeding tendency. However, the study did not rule out the possibility that a low protein Z level may be a weak cofactor associated with an increased bleeding tendency, and did not indicate whether decreased or absent protein Z may result in a hemorrhagic diathesis.
Reports of Increased Thrombosis
Vasse et al. (2001) analyzed plasma protein Z levels in 56 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), 169 patients with ischemic stroke, and 88 controls. There was no significant difference in mean protein Z concentrations between the deep venous thrombosis group and the controls, and 5% of individuals in both groups had protein Z deficiency. In patients with ischemic stroke, however, protein Z levels were lower than the normal range, and 33 of these patients (20%) had protein Z deficiency.
In a study of 450 women with unexplained fetal loss and 200 controls, Gris et al. (2002) found an association between decreased plasma protein Z levels and early fetal demise (odds ratio (OR) of 6.7, p less than 0.003). Gris et al. (2002) postulated that protein Z deficiency may induce an enhanced risk of severe placental insufficiency soon after the connection of maternal and fetal circulations.
Santacroce et al. (2006) found similar protein Z levels in 197 patients with deep vein thrombosis and healthy controls. However, the incidence of protein Z levels below the 5.0 or 2.5% ranges was higher in patients (10.2% and 8.7%, respectively) than in controls (4.1 and 2.0%, respectively), yielding an odds ratio of 2.7 and 4.6, respectively, for the risk of DVT in individuals with low protein Z levels. The authors concluded that very low levels of protein Z may be associated with an increased risk of DVT.
In a metaanalysis involving 28 case-control studies including 4,218 patients with thrombotic diseases and 4,778 controls, Sofi et al. (2010) found that low protein Z levels were associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (OR of 2.90, p less than 0.00001). By subgroup analysis, significant associations were found between low protein Z levels and arterial vascular diseases (OR of 2.67, p = 0.0002), pregnancy complications (OR of 4.17, p less than 0.00001), and venous thromboembolic diseases (OR of 2.18, p = 0.01). These results were consistent with a role for protein Z deficiency in various thrombotic diseases, including arterial thrombosis, pregnancy complications, and venous thromboembolism.

TXNRD2
**?Glucocorticoid deficiency 5, 617825 (3), AR**
Familial glucocorticoid deficiency-5 is characterized by resistance to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and isolated glucocorticoid deficiency, with typical biochemical findings of low serum cortisol levels and high plasma ACTH. Patients commonly present with hyperpigmentation (Prasad et al., 2014).
For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, see GCCD1 (202200).
Prasad et al. (2014) reported a large consanguineous Kashmiri family in which 7 members had isolated glucocorticoid deficiency. The index patient was diagnosed at age 10.8 years, after hyperpigmentation occurred during febrile illnesses. Laboratory evaluation revealed low serum cortisol with elevated plasma ACTH, consistent with ACTH resistance. Her sister was subsequently diagnosed at age 4.5 years, with a 2-year history of hyperpigmentation. The proband had 4 children, 3 of whom were screened at birth and diagnosed with glucocorticoid deficiency between the ages of 1 month and 7 years, including 1 girl whose ACTH level was initially elevated but normalized for a time before she was diagnosed at age 6.9 years. The fourth child had elevated ACTH levels in infancy but later showed normalization and was clinically well at age 7.4 years. The proband's sister had a son who presented at age 1 month with cardiac failure due to truncus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect. During that hospitalization he was also diagnosed with isolated glucocorticoid deficiency. All affected individuals demonstrated a poor cortisol response to ACTH stimulation, requiring glucocorticoid replacement therapy, and all had normal mineralocorticoid production.





BCKDHB
**Maple syrup urine disease, type Ib, 248600 (3), AR**
The major clinical features of maple syrup urine disease are mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. The keto acids of the branched-chain amino acids are present in the urine, resulting from a block in oxidative decarboxylation. There are 5 clinical subtypes of MSUD: the 'classic' neonatal severe form, an 'intermediate' form, an 'intermittent' form, a 'thiamine-responsive' form, and an 'E3-deficient with lactic acidosis' form (246900). All of these subtypes can be caused by mutations in any of the 4 genes mentioned above, except for the E3-deficient form, which is caused only by mutation in the E3 gene (Chuang and Shih, 2001).
Classic Severe MSUD
Menkes et al. (1954) reported a familial syndrome in which 4 sibs had progressive infantile cerebral dysfunction associated with an unusual urinary substance. Onset was in the first week of life, with death by 3 months of age. The urine had an odor resembling maple syrup. Referring to the syndrome as 'maple syrup urine disease,' Westall et al. (1957) found that the levels of branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, were greatly elevated. Menkes (1959) isolated and identified the corresponding keto acids in the urine of affected patients, suggesting that the catabolic pathways of the branched-chain amino acids were blocked at the decarboxylation step. Dancis et al. (1960) also referred to the disorder as 'branched-chain ketoaciduria.'
In classic MSUD, which is the most common form of the disorder, 50% or more of the keto acids are derived from leucine, and the activity of the BCKD complex is less than 2% of normal. Affected newborns appear normal at birth, with symptoms developing between 4 and 7 days of age. The infants show lethargy, weight loss, metabolic derangement, and progressive neurologic signs of altering hypotonia and hypertonia, reflecting a severe encephalopathy. Seizures and coma usually occur, followed by death if untreated (Chuang and Shih, 2001).
Wong et al. (1972) reported a case of classic MSUD. DiGeorge et al. (1982) made important observations on the course of classic MSUD in the first 4 days of life when an affected child was on a diet devoid of branched-chain amino acids. Although the branched-chain amino acids were normal in cord blood, serum leucine was significantly elevated by 4 to 14 hours of age and rose progressively thereafter, permitting an accurate and early diagnosis. However, Shih (1984) emphasized that classic MSUD may be missed in newborn screening because of slow rise of blood leucine levels.
Frezal et al. (1985) observed a family in which 2 different forms of MSUD occurred in the same family. The proposita had an acute neonatal form; 2 of her sisters had an almost asymptomatic form which the authors thought represented compound heterozygosity for the classic mutant and a partial variant. The proband did not respond to thiamine.
Kaplan et al. (1989) described psychometric testing on 9 girls and 7 boys with MSUD. They concluded that prospective or early treatment significantly improves the intellectual outcome and that poor biochemical control may adversely affect performance.
Van Calcar et al. (1992) described a 25-year-old woman with classic MSUD who was diagnosed at the age of 11 days and was successfully treated with dietary restrictions. She was followed closely during a pregnancy, with delivery of a healthy baby whose length and weight were at the 5th centile.
Intermediate MSUD
Schulman et al. (1970) first described intermediate MSUD in a 19-month-old patient who was being evaluated for mental retardation. She had normal physical growth but severe developmental delay. She had mild systemic acidosis and markedly increased levels of plasma branched-chain amino acids and urinary branched-chain keto acids. Protein restriction was effective, but thiamine administration was not. The patient had 15 to 25% residual BCKD activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts. Kalyanaraman et al. (1972) reported 2 patients with the intermediate form of MSUD manifesting as hyperkinetic behavior and mental retardation.
Chhabria et al. (1979) reported a neonate who presented with ophthalmoplegia and was later found to have intermediate MSUD with residual BCKD complex activity. They noted that 2 similar cases with MSUD and ophthalmoplegia had previously been reported.
Gonzalez-Rios et al. (1985) reported a boy with intermediate MSUD who presented at age 10 months in ketoacidotic coma, with a history of irritability, poor feeding, and growth and developmental delay. branched chain amino acid restriction resulted in normal growth and development by age 42 months, but thiamine was not effective. The authors determined that the defect was in the catalytic activity of the E1 component of the BCKD complex, but there was some residual enzyme activity.
Schadewaldt et al. (2001) determined whole-body L-leucine oxidation in MSUD patients. In 4 patients with classic MSUD, L-leucine oxidation was too low to be measurable. In 2 females with a severe variant form of the disease, L-leucine oxidation was about 4% of control. In 6 milder variants, including intermediates, the estimates for residual whole-body L-leucine oxidation ranged from 19 to 86% (59 +/- 24%) of control, and were substantially higher than the residual branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex activities in the patients' fibroblasts (10 to 25% of control).
Intermittent MSUD
Morris et al. (1961) reported a 24-month-old female with intermittent MSUD. She was asymptomatic until age 16 months when she had recurrent episodic ataxia, lethargy, semicoma, and elevated urinary branched-chain keto acids following otitis media. Similarly, her younger brother was normal until about age 10 months when he had an acute episode. Dietary protein restriction was effective (see also Morris et al., 1966).
In 2 sibs of each of 2 families, Dancis et al. (1967) observed intermittent MSUD. The children suffered from a transient neurologic disorder associated with elevation of branched-chain amino acids and keto acids in the urine as well as a distinctive odor to the urine. One sib of each family died during an attack. Late onset of symptoms and clinical normality between attacks differentiated the condition from classic MSUD. In addition, the level of leukocyte BCKD complex activity seemed to be higher than in the classic form of the disease.
Two Norwegian families with the intermittent form were described by Goedde et al. (1970). They noted that in the intermittent form, only 1 parent shows decreased enzyme activity. Van der Horst and Wadman (1971) described an intermittent form with severe episodes of acidosis with mental retardation that was partially reversed on dietary therapy. Other cases of intermittent MSUD were reported by Kiil and Rokkones (1964), Valman et al. (1973), and Indo et al. (1988).
Thiamine-responsive MSUD
Scriver et al. (1971) described a variant of MSUD in which the hyperaminoacidemia was completely corrected by thiamine hydrochloride (10 mg per day) with dietary restriction (see also Scriver et al., 1985). Duran et al. (1978) and Duran and Wadman (1985) reported successful treatment of MSUD with thiamine administration.
Chuang et al. (1982) found that BCKDH complex activity in thiamine-responsive MSUD is about 30 to 40% the normal rate. Further studies showed that the primary defect in thiamine-responsive MSUD is reduced affinity of the mutant BCKD for thiamine pyrophosphate.
In 2 cases of MSUD responsive to thiamine administration, Zhang et al. (1990) found that the sequence of the gene for the E1-alpha subunit was normal. The result was considered consistent with any of the following possibilities: that the thiamine-binding site involves the E1-beta subunit, that the binding site is on E1-alpha, but a mutation elsewhere in the complex alters the affinity of the thiamine-binding site by an allosteric interaction, or that the clinical response to thiamine is due to stabilization of the enzyme that has a mutation in either the E1-beta or the E2 protein.
Fenugreek Tea
In a report from Tunisia, Monastiri et al. (1997) noted that since maple syrup is largely unknown by Mediterranean populations, the odor of the urine in MSUD is more reminiscent of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum L.) than of maple syrup. Fenugreek beans are traditionally used by Mediterranean populations as an infusion for sick persons (Boukef et al., 1982), and its fragrant smell is disagreeable and well known in that area. Monastiri et al. (1997) suggested that physicians in Mediterranean countries should keep in mind that a fenugreek odor of urine with neurologic distress in newborn infants, without a history of fenugreek ingestion by the mother of the baby, should raise a suspicion of MSUD.
Sewell et al. (1999) described a case of 'pseudo-maple syrup urine disease' caused by drinking fenugreek tea. The 5-week-old Egyptian infant had a 10-minute episode of unconsciousness while drinking bottled tea. He recovered spontaneously, but the parents nevertheless sought medical attention. On examination, the child was found to exude an aroma similar to that of Maggi (a widely available flavoring), and a spontaneously voided urine sample had a similar aroma. The parents indicated that the child had been given herbal tea (Helba tea) to reduce flatulence and prevent fever. This tea contains seeds of fenugreek. Analysis of the infant's urine revealed the presence of sotolone, the compound responsible for the aroma in maple syrup urine disease (Podebrad et al., 1999). Tea prepared from fenugreek seeds was found to contain sotolone. Bartley et al. (1981) had reported a similar case. Since herbal teas are popular as home remedies, particularly in Middle Eastern countries, physicians should use caution when they are presented with young infants from such countries, to avoid unnecessary and costly investigations.



SMG9
**Heart and brain malformation syndrome, 616920 (3), AR**
Heart and brain malformation syndrome is a severe autosomal recessive multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by profoundly delayed psychomotor development, dysmorphic facial features, microphthalmia, cardiac malformations, mainly septal defects, and brain malformations, including Dandy-Walker malformation (summary by Shaheen et al., 2016).
Shaheen et al. (2016) reported 2 unrelated consanguineous families of Arab origin in which 5 patients had a severe multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. In the first family, the proband was a female infant who died at age 7 weeks. Antenatal ultrasound showed polyhydramnios, splaying of the cerebellum, and a ventricular septal defect. At birth, she showed craniofacial abnormalities, including prominent forehead and occiput, wide anterior fontanel, low-set malformed ears, depressed nasal bridge with anteverted nares, microphthalmia, and high-arched palate. She also had clenched hands with camptodactyly. Brain imaging showed Dandy-Walker malformation, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and hypoplastic corpus callosum. Cardiac abnormalities included interrupted aortic arch, hypoplastic valves, and ventricular septal defect. She developed seizures and sepsis, resulting in death. Family history revealed that the mother had a history of 3 abortions, and there were 2 older sibs with multiple congenital anomalies who died in utero or in the first year of life. In a second family, 2 children, aged 2 and 3 years, had poor overall growth, dysmorphic features, microcephaly (up to -6 SD), profoundly delayed psychomotor development with hypotonia and hyperreflexia, poor vision, and cardiac ventricular septal defects. Brain imaging in both patients showed brain atrophy; 1 patient had Dandy-Walker malformation and decreased myelination, whereas the other had a thin corpus callosum. Dysmorphic features were detailed in 1 patient, who showed narrow forehead, prominent metopic suture, widow's peak, hypertelorism, posteriorly rotated ears, broad nasal bridge, full and everted lower lip, cleft lip, and small eyes. Laboratory studies were unremarkable.



CFH
**Basal laminar drusen, 126700 (3), AD**
Drusen are extracellular deposits that accumulate below the retinal pigment epithelium on Bruch membrane. They appear as slightly raised, yellow subretinal nodules randomly scattered in the macula. 'Drusen' is the plural for 'Druse,' German for 'nodule' or 'crystal' (summary by Bok, 2002, Boon et al., 2008).
'Basal laminar drusen' refers to an early adult-onset drusen phenotype that shows a pattern of uniform small (25- to 75-micrometer), slightly raised yellow subretinal nodules randomly scattered in the macula (Boon et al., 2008). The term 'basal laminar drusen' is widely used but may be a misnomer because these deposits do not appear to correspond with nodular or diffuse thickening of the Bruch membrane. In later stages, these drusen often become more numerous, with clustered groups of drusen scattered throughout the retina. On fluorescein angiography, a typical 'stars in the sky' appearance may be observed. In time these small basal laminar drusen may expand and ultimately lead to a serous pigment epithelial detachment of the macula that may result in vision loss.
Deutman and Jansen (1970) described a family in which 8 persons in 5 sibships had confirmed multiple drusen of Bruch membrane. There was no instance of male-to-male transmission but an affected male had 2 daughters who were negative by examination. They observed concordant monozygotic twins and affected boys 12 and 14 years old. They concluded that the family with 'crystalline retinal degeneration' reported by Evans (1950) had this condition. The authors also concluded that Doyne honeycomb choroiditis (126600) is the same condition. Round or oval lesions in almost grape-like clusters are concentrated in the posterior polar region. Pigmentary disturbances with secondary calcifications occur. The macula is almost always involved and may appear edematous or hemorrhagic. Loss of vision occurs during the progressive stages. This is considered a form of fleck retina disease (see 228980).
Bok (2002) stated that there was widespread agreement among ophthalmologists that numerous large drusen, when present in both eyes, represent a significant risk factor for the evolution of early age-related macular dystrophy (ARMD1; 603075) into more advanced ARMD, with loss of central vision.
**Complement factor H deficiency, 609814 (3), AR, AD**
Complement factor H deficiency (CFHD) can manifest as several different phenotypes, including asymptomatic, recurrent bacterial infections, and renal failure. Laboratory features usually include decreased serum levels of factor H, complement component C3 (120700), and a decrease in other alternative pathway components, indicating activation of the alternative complement pathway. Homozygotes and heterozygotes may show increased susceptibility to meningococcal infections. In addition, a number of renal diseases have been associated with factor H defect or deficiency, including atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS; 235400), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN II), and nonspecific hematuria or nephritis (Ault, 2000). See also complement factor I deficiency (610984), which shows phenotypic overlap with this disorder.
Welch (2002) discussed the role of complement in renal disease.
Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis type II
Abrera-Abeleda et al. (2006) summarized features of MPGN relevant to the complement cascade. MPGN type II, also known as dense deposit disease, causes chronic renal dysfunction that progresses to end-stage renal disease in about half of patients within 10 years of diagnosis. MPGN types I and III are variants of immune complex-mediated disease; MPGN II, in contrast, has no known association with immune complexes (Appel et al., 2005). MPGN II accounts for less than 20% of cases of MPGN in children and only a fractional percentage of cases in adults. Both sexes are affected equally, with the diagnosis usually made in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years who present with nonspecific findings such as hematuria, proteinuria, acute nephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome. More than 80% of patients with MPGN II are positive for serum C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF), an autoantibody directed against C3bBb, the convertase of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade. C3NeF prolongs the half-life of C3 convertase. Patients with MPGN type II without C3NeF often have mutations in the CFH gene, which also results in prolonged activation of C3 convertase.
Wyatt et al. (1982) reported 2 families with partial factor H deficiency and glomerulonephritis. In 1 family, of Polish origin, a teenaged male had vasculitis, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, and depressed levels of serum factor H and complement component C3. The mother, maternal uncle, and a cousin had depressed H levels. The second family was of English-Irish extraction living in Kentucky; 3 persons in 3 generations had H levels about half normal. The index case had depressed serum factors H and B levels and IgA nephropathy (161950) which progressed to renal failure. A sister also had IgA nephropathy and depressed serum H and C3 levels.
Levy et al. (1986) reported a consanguineous Algerian family in which 2 brothers had early-onset glomerulonephritis with C3 deposits and low levels (less than 10% of normal) of complement factor H. The factor H deficiency was defined by undetectable complement hemolytic activity by the classic (CH50) and alternate (AP50) pathways, and low levels of C3 and factor B (138470). The unaffected first-cousin parents and 2 healthy sibs, presumed heterozygotes, had half-normal H values. Renal disease was discovered at 14 and 4 months of age in the elder and younger brother, respectively. The elder had recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria occurring during the course of infections but did not seem to have an excessive number of infections; the younger had repeated upper and lower respiratory tract infections and nearly persistent macroscopic hematuria. Electron microscopy of renal biopsies from both patients were typical for intramembranous dense deposit disease, but immunofluorescence microscopy showed an atypical pattern with abundant granular C3 deposits within the mesangium and along the capillary walls.
Lopez-Larrea et al. (1987) studied a family in which 3 female sibs had undetectable levels of factor H and C3 nephritic factor, low levels of factor B, C3, and C5 (see 120500), and normal levels of C4-binding protein (120830), factor I (217030), and classic pathway factors. C4 (see 120810) levels were low in 1 patient. Two of the sibs had Neisseria meningitidis sepsis; all 3 developed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.
Brai et al. (1988) and Misiano et al. (1993) described a consanguineous Italian family in which 3 sibs had deficiency of factor H and its spliced isoform FHL1. The proband had systemic lupus erythematosus (152700) with chronic renal failure and had highly reduced C3 serum levels and low concentrations of C5-C9. She had suffered from skin lesions (chronic discoid plaques on sun-exposed areas), with ulcerations and central nervous system involvement with psychosis. Her 2 affected brothers showed a similar serum complement profile. They had suffered from 3 and 1 episodes, respectively, of meningococcal meningitis, without autoimmune disease. Factor H was undetectable in all affected sibs, and both parents presented serum concentrations of factor H that were about 50% of normal. Western blot analysis showed the absence of both factor H and FHL1 in the affected sibs. The father and 2 of the H-deficient sibs, including the proband, also had a partial C2 deficiency (217000).
Nielsen et al. (1989) described a 15-year-old girl with a complete deficiency of factor H. Both parents had half normal levels. The girl had 2 episodes of meningococcal disease. The degree of H reduction was sufficient to cause increased, spontaneous activation of the alternative complement pathway.
Fijen et al. (1996) described a Dutch family in which both heterozygous and homozygous factor H deficiency was observed. The proband of the family suffered from subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and had had meningococcal meningitis. Western blot analysis showed complete factor H deficiency. Among 21 relatives of the proband encompassing 3 generations, 10 had low factor H levels, including 2 children of the proband, indicating heterozygosity. Serum studies showed decreased levels of components of the alternative complement pathway.
Vogt et al. (1995) reported a 6-year-old Native American (Sioux) boy who presented at age 13 months with hypocomplementemic hypertensive renal disease. Renal biopsy showed changes consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, deposition of type III collagen (120180), and segmental complement C3 deposition in capillary loops. Decreased levels of serum C3 and factor B but normal levels of serum C4 and factor I were found; factor H was undetectable by radial immunodiffusion analysis. Slightly depressed levels of factor H were present in both parents; his sibs had normal levels. Ault et al. (1997) reported that the child originally described by Vogt et al. (1995) underwent renal transplantation at age 7; serum C3 concentrations remained low thereafter, as did factor H levels. Western blot analysis of the patient's plasma before and after renal transplantation showed slightly increased concentration of the 45-kD factor H and no detectable 150-kD factor H when compared with 7 normal plasma samples. Ault et al. (1997) demonstrated that the patient's fibroblasts retained 155-kD factor H protein, which was not degraded even after 12 hours, and showed that factor H was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Licht et al. (2006) reported 2 girls, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with early onset of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II. Renal biopsies showed thickening of the glomerular basement membrane caused by dense deposits in the lamina densa. Immunohistochemistry showed deposition of C3. Laboratory analysis showed activation of both the alternative and classical complement pathway, and both patients and their asymptomatic mother also had autoantibodies to C3 nephritic factor (C3Nef). Genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in the CFH gene (134370.0014) in the patients; both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.
Servais et al. (2007) described a unique form of glomerulonephritis characterized by isolated mesangial C3 deposits without dense intramembranous deposits or mesangial proliferation, which the authors termed 'glomerulonephritis C3.' Heterozygous mutations in complement regulatory genes were identified in 4 of 6 unrelated patients with glomerulonephritis C3, including 2 patients each with mutations in the CFH (see, e.g., 134370.0017) and CFI genes (see, e.g., 217030.0007), respectively. In addition, 1 of 13 unrelated patients with glomerulonephritis with MPGN also had a heterozygous CFH mutation. The findings indicated that dysregulation of the complement alternative pathway is associated with a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from HUS to MPGN with C3 deposits.
**{Hemolytic uremic syndrome, atypical, susceptibility to, 1}, 235400 (3), AR, AD**
Typical hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia associated with distorted erythrocytes ('burr cells'). The vast majority of cases (90%) are sporadic, occur in children under 3 years of age, and are associated with epidemics of diarrhea caused by verotoxin-producing E. coli. The death rate is very low, about 30% of cases have renal sequelae, and there is usually no relapse of the disease. This form of HUS usually presents with a diarrhea prodrome (thus referred to as D+HUS) and has a good prognosis in most cases. In contrast, a subgroup of patients with HUS have an atypical presentation (aHUS or D-HUS) without a prodrome of enterocolitis and diarrhea and have a much poorer prognosis, with a tendency to relapse and frequent development of end-stage renal failure or death. These cases tend to be familial. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported (Goodship et al., 1997; Taylor, 2001; Veyradier et al., 2003; Noris et al., 2003). Noris and Remuzzi (2009) provided a detailed review of atypical HUS.
Genetic Heterogeneity of Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
Atypical HUS is a genetically heterogeneous condition. Susceptibility to the development of the disorder can be conferred by mutations in various components of or regulatory factors in the complement cascade system (Jozsi et al., 2008). See AHUS2 (612922), AHUS3 (612923), AHUS4 (612924), AHUS5 (612925), and AHUS6 (612926). AHUS7 (see 615008) is caused by mutation in the DGKE gene (601440), which is not part of the complement cascade system.
Hagge et al. (1967) reported the hemolytic uremic syndrome in 2 sibs. Features included intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and azotemia. One had repeated attacks ending in renal failure and death at age 8 years; the other recovered completely after one attack. Chan et al. (1969) reported HUS in 2 adopted, unrelated sibs.
Kaplan et al. (1975) reported HUS in 3 sibs and reviewed reports of 21 sibships with 2 or more affected individuals. Two groups of families could be identified among 41 analyzed. Sibs whose onset was within a short time of each other had a relatively good prognosis (19% mortality). Those whose onset was more than a year apart had a poorer prognosis (68% mortality). Kaplan et al. (1975) suggested that an environmental agent was causative in the first group and that genetic factors were important in the second. Most of the first group of families came from an endemic area, whereas most of the second group came from a nonendemic area.
Blattler et al. (1975) studied a family in which 4 sibs had died from HUS. The parents and 4 surviving sibs had normal renal function and normal platelet and fibrinogen survival. The mother and 3 sibs had an increased percentage of megathrombocytes. Two of them showed renal accumulation of Cr 51-platelet radioactivity and ultrastructural changes of the endothelium on renal biopsy.
Edelsten and Tuck (1978) reported a family with HUS inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
Thompson and Winterborn (1981) reported an 8-month-old Asian boy with very low levels of plasma factor H who presented with the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Complement component C3 (120700) was also depleted. A healthy 3-year-old brother had the same complement profile, suggesting activation of the alternative complement pathway. The parents, who were first cousins, had half-normal levels of factor H.
Kirchner et al. (1982) described this disorder in mother and daughter. The daughter's illness, characterized primarily by renal insufficiency, was most compatible with adult hemolytic uremic syndrome and the mother's illness, with prominent neurologic findings, was most compatible with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Merrill et al. (1985) reported 2 certain cases and 3 possible case in 2 generations of a North Carolina black family.
Neuhaus et al. (1997) reported clinical features of atypical D-HUS in 23 children. Features included requirement for dialysis (74%), hypertension (43%), cardiomyopathy (43%), and cerebral convulsions (48%). Only 5 patients (26%), including 4 infants, recovered completely. Six patients (32%) had 1 to 10 recurrences and 8 (42%) developed end-stage renal failure. Four children died.
Warwicker et al. (1998) reported a 36-year-old man with sporadic relapsing aHUS. He had anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and acute renal failure. Renal biopsy showed a thrombotic microangiopathy and deposition of complement component C3 in vessel walls. He had half-normal serum levels of factor H and decreased levels of C3, consistent with activation of the alternative complement pathway. HUS recurred after renal transplantation. Molecular analysis revealed a heterozygous 4-bp deletion in the CFH gene (134370.0011).
Ohali et al. (1998) reported a large consanguineous Bedouin family in which 10 infants had atypical HUS characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, severe hypertension, edema, and increased serum triglycerides. All had very early onset with a median presentation at age 2 weeks. Two patients died during the first disease episode; the remaining 8 patients had a mean number of 4 relapses despite treatment. In total, 8 patients died at ages 3 weeks to 10 months. Factor H levels were low to undetectable in all 4 patients studied, and C3 levels were decreased in 9 of 10 infants tested. Four kidney biopsies showed marked arteriolar changes, including stenosis, edema, and thickening of the intima. Glomerular changes included swelling of endothelial cells with microvillus transformation and proliferation of mesangial cells with increased matrix deposition in the mesangium. Other changes included fibrotic changes in glomeruli and the tubulointerstitium, as well as C3 deposition in capillary walls.
Rougier et al. (1998) reported 6 children with complement factor H deficiency and acute glomerular disease. Five of the 6 children presented with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Two of the children were from a consanguineous family from Turkey and exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by absence of the 150-kD form of factor H.
Noris et al. (2003) reported a 21-year-old woman and her affected brother. Disease onset in the sister (the proband) was at age 16 months, when she developed fever, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. At the time, renal function was normal. Thereafter she had 6 recurrences of thrombotic microangiopathy, all associated with deteriorating renal function. Treatment consisted of plasma exchange and infusions, steroids, and blood transfusions, which led to complete recovery of blood abnormalities and renal function. The last episode occurred at age 20 years and was characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, and severe impairment of renal function. Renal biopsy showed irreversible changes of chronic nephropathy with typical features of HUS, including diffuse narrowing/occlusion of vessels and severe glomerular ischemia. At the age of 21 years she was on chronic dialysis. The proband's brother had 2 episodes of HUS at age 9 years. Both were characterized by severe hemolytic anemia and acute renal insufficiency and resolved without plasma treatment, with no renal sequelae.

CACNA1F
**Aland Island eye disease, 300600 (3), X-linked**
Aland Island eye disease (AIED) is an X-linked recessive retinal disease characterized by fundus hypopigmentation, decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, astigmatism, protan color vision defect (303900), progressive myopia, and defective dark adaptation. Although AIED has been referred to as a form of albinism, there is no misrouting of the optic nerves, which excludes it from the formal diagnosis of classic albinism (King et al., 2001).
Forsius and Eriksson (1964) reported X-linked tapetoretinal degeneration in a family described in a family from the Aland Islands in the Sea of Bothnia. Males in 6 generations were affected with hypopigmentation of the fundus, foveal hypoplasia, marked impairment of vision, nystagmus, myopia, astigmatism, and protan colorblindness. Female carriers showed slight disturbances of color discrimination and electromyographically demonstrable nystagmus. Warburg (1964) described ocular albinism and protanopia in the same Aland Island kindred family. Only 2 of 4 males with ocular albinism showed dyschromatopsia. The absence of characteristic fundus pigmentary pattern in female carriers in the family of Forsius and Eriksson suggested that they had a distinct entity from X-linked Nettleship-Falls ocular albinism (OA1; 300500). Scialfa (1967) reported another family with this disorder.
By electron microscopic study of skin biopsies obtained by Forsius in the Island of Aland, O'Donnell and Green (1978) and O'Donnell et al. (1980) concluded that the Forsius-Eriksson type is morphologically distinct from the Nettleship-Falls type of ocular albinism; no macromelanosomes were present.
By electrophysiologic studies, van Dorp et al. (1985) showed that there is no misrouting of the optic pathways in Aland Eye disease, thus distinguishing it from true albinism. Other differences from albinism, not commented on earlier, included differences in the spontaneous and optokinetic nystagmus.
Maumenee (1986) expressed the opinion that this disorder may be a variety of achromatopsia.
Weleber et al. (1989) pointed out that newer electrophysiologic techniques, including electroretinography, show many differences between this disorder and OA1; however, the disorder showed some similarities to X-linked incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (300071).
Glass et al. (1991, 1993) reported studies of a 6-generation family with 9 affected males and 14 obligatory carriers. Clinical features included severely reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, high axial myopia, foveal hypoplasia, and protanomalous color vision deficiency associated with minor fundal depigmentation. Although impaired night vision was not a symptom, psychophysical and electrophysiologic testing showed that both rod and cone function were abnormal in all affected males. No abnormality was detected in carrier females. The findings were similar to those previously reported in both CSNB2A and AIED.
Jalkanen et al. (2007) stated that although AIED and CSNB2A are allelic disorders, there are a few distinct differences between the symptoms of the patients in the original AIED family and those described as having CSNB2A. AIED has progressive myopic refraction, foveal dysplasia with no foveal reflex, and a protan defect in color vision (303900), whereas CSNB2A is apparently stationary with a normal fovea and mostly normal color vision, with tritan (190900) or mixed defects in some cases. They suggested that the differences my be attributable to differences in genetic background (i.e., other genes or genetic modifiers).
Hawksworth et al. (1995) studied a Welch kindred in which congenital nystagmus and moderate-to-high refractive error segregated as an X-linked trait, with manifestation in some female carriers. Affected males demonstrated myopia, but a high proportion of female carriers and some of the possibly affected males showed hypermetropia. Clinical ophthalmologic examination and electrodiagnostic studies of retinal function were compatible with a diagnosis of either incomplete congenital stationary night blindness or Aland island eye disease. Hawksworth et al. (1995) raised the question of whether the 2 entities are the same.
**Cone-rod dystrophy, X-linked, 3, 300476 (3), XLR**
Cone-rod dystrophy is a retinal disorder with predominantly cone involvement. Rod impairment may occur at the same time as the cone impairment or appear later. Patients with CORD usually have reduced visual acuity, photophobia, and color vision defects (summary by Huang et al., 2013).
For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of X-linked cone-rod dystrophy, see 304020.
Mantyjarvi et al. (2001) described a large 6-generation Finnish family in which 10 male members, ranging in age from 6 to 81 years, had progressive cone-rod dystrophy. Onset of symptoms was in early childhood for most patients, although some were not diagnosed until the fourth or fifth decade of life. Visual acuities ranged from 20/40 to counting fingers, and all were myopic. Concentrically constricted visual fields were observed in 5 patients, 1 of whom also had central scotomas; of the remaining 5, 3 showed general reduction of sensitivity in the central fields. Of 7 patients in whom color vision was assessed, 6 had red/green or red defects and 1 showed normal color vision. Of 5 patients in whom dark adaptation was examined, all had an elevated rod threshold and 3 also had an elevated cone threshold. Of 5 patients in whom ERG was performed, all exhibited defective cone responses, with 1 also showing reduction of the rod response. Funduscopic examination showed myopic changes and irregular pigmentation in the macular area. Two patients underwent surgery for unilateral retinal detachment. Follow-up over 12 to 14 years of 4 affected family members showed no changes in fundus appearance, visual fields, or dark adaptation; however, visual acuity had decreased in 1 patient, reduced sensitivity of the visual fields was noted in 2, and error scores in the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue (FM100) test had increased in 3, suggesting retinal progression of the disease. Examination of 6 obligate carriers showed normal fundi, visual fields, and color vision.
Hauke et al. (2013) examined 4 of 10 affected male members over 3 generations of a large German family with a progressive retinal disorder. Features typical of X-linked cone-rod dystrophy in these patients included slowly progressive loss of visual acuity, moderate to high myopia, color vision defects, elevated cone and rod thresholds in dark adaptation, reduced cone and rod responses on full-field ERGs, and irregular pigmentation in the macular area in the younger patients. In addition, 3 of the 4 exhibited nystagmus, and 2 had astigmatism of more than 1.5 diopters, both of which are features considered atypical in CORDX3. Examination of 2 asymptomatic female obligate carriers showed normal funduscopy, visual fields, and color vision, with responses in the low-normal range on ERGs.
**Night blindness, congenital stationary (incomplete), 2A, X-linked, 300071 (3), X-linked**
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness is a nonprogressive retinal disorder characterized by decreased visual acuity and loss of night vision. Bergen et al. (1995) stated that X-linked CSNB (CSNBX) is clinically heterogeneous with respect to the involvement of retinal rods and/or cones in the disease. The classic form of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1; 310500) is associated with myopia.
All affected members of the family mapped by Bergen et al. (1996) to Xp21.1 had myopia and a fine horizontal nystagmus. None of them experienced deterioration, during an average follow-up of 5 years, of their visual acuity or ERG recordings. The 6 obligate carriers and 1 possible carrier had normal visual acuity, no myopia, and no abnormalities on ERG. The affected males, apart from night blindness as shown by the dark adaptation curves, had no clinical or electrophysiologic signs of retinitis pigmentosa.



CYP11A1
**Adrenal insufficiency, congenital, with 46XY sex reversal, partial or complete, 613743 (3)**
P450scc deficiency is a rare disorder that can present as acute adrenal insufficiency in infancy or childhood. ACTH and plasma renin activity are grossly elevated and adrenal steroids are inappropriately low or absent; the 46,XY patients have female external genitalia, sometimes with clitoromegaly. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from prematurity, complete underandrogenization, and severe early-onset adrenal failure to term birth with clitoromegaly and later-onset adrenal failure (summary by Kim et al., 2008).
Although hormonal and phenotypic features can resemble those of congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (lipoid CAH; 201710), no patient with P450scc deficiency has been described with the massive adrenal enlargement typical of lipoid CAH (summary by Sahakitrungruang et al., 2011).
In studying patients with clinical features of lipoid CAH, Tajima et al. (2001) encountered an individual with a heterozygous mutation in P450scc. The patient presented at 4 years of age with lethargy and hyperpigmentation. Serum sodium and potassium were both normal, but ACTH was extremely elevated, plasma aldosterone was elevated, and cortisol was low. The karyotype was 46,XY; the patient had clitoromegaly, no labial fusion, and separate vaginal and urethral openings. Computed tomographic and ultrasonographic examinations revealed no hypertrophy of the adrenal glands, and no uterus. Inguinal hernias had been diagnosed at 2 years of age, and inguinal masses had been resected at another clinic; Tajima et al. (2001) remarked that these were probably testes. Vaginography demonstrated a blind vaginal pouch. The patient was treated with hydrocortisone and 9-alpha-fluorocortisone; she became more active and the hyperpigmentation disappeared. Tajima et al. (2001) noted that the slower, more insidious onset of adrenal insufficiency and absence of enlarged adrenals were atypical of lipoid CAH.
Katsumata et al. (2002) reported a child with congenital adrenal insufficiency who at the age of 7 months presented with hyperpigmentation and markedly elevated ACTH levels. At the age of 9 months, endocrinologic investigation revealed increased levels of ACTH and inappropriately normal levels of cortisol, aldosterone (high normal), and 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Electrolyte and plasma glucose levels were normal. The karyotype was 46,XX. Serum FSH (136530) approached the upper limit of normal, suggesting to Katsumata et al. (2002) the possibility of early ovarian insufficiency. The patient was successfully treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
Hiort et al. (2005) described a patient who presented with severe adrenal insufficiency in the first days of life. The child was born at 31 weeks' gestation. The karyotype was 46,XY; the baby's phenotype was unequivocally female with an unusual bronze skin color. Severe salt wasting was present in the neonatal period. Plasma ACTH and renin activity were extremely elevated. Plasma cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were undetectable. The child developed respiratory failure and was put on a respiratory ventilator. Treatment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone produced rapid improvement. Urinary steroid analysis at the age of 2 months did not demonstrate any excretion of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroids, suggesting complete loss of steroidogenesis. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging failed to demonstrate gonads or adrenal tissue, and no uterus was seen.
Al Kandari et al. (2006) reported a 46,XY phenotypic female who presented with life-threatening adrenal insufficiency at the age of 1 year 9 months. Generalized tanning of skin was present with markedly increased pigmentation of lips and gums, nape of neck, and abdomen. ACTH and plasma renin activity were extremely elevated, with very low or undetectable aldosterone. Treatment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone produced dramatic improvement. External genitalia were those of a normal female. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging identified bilateral small gonads in inguinal regions, and adrenal glands of normal size. Genitogram showed short, blunt-ended vagina. Computed tomography revealed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Developmental milestones had been normal to this time.
Kim et al. (2008) reviewed the findings in all patients reported to that time with P450scc deficiency, including the patients described by Tajima et al. (2001), Katsumata et al. (2002), Hiort et al. (2005), and Al Kandari et al. (2006), as well as 2 new patients. They noted that the phenotypic spectrum ranged from prematurity, complete underandrogenization, and severe early-onset adrenal failure resulting from severe loss-of-function mutations (Hiort et al., 2005) to term birth with clitoromegaly and later-onset adrenal failure resulting from partial deficiency (Tajima et al., 2001). In all cases ACTH and plasma renin activity were grossly elevated and adrenal steroids were inappropriately low or absent. In contradistinction to the massive adrenal enlargement typically seen in lipoid CAH, caused by mutation in StAR (600617), none of the 6 patients with P450scc deficiency had been reported to have adrenal hyperplasia.
Rubtsov et al. (2009) described a patient with P450scc deficiency who showed no overt signs of adrenal insufficiency until the age of 9 years, when he began to experience episodes of weakness, dizziness, and vomiting. At birth he presented with bilateral cryptorchidism with inguinal testes, midshaft hypospadias, and bilateral talipes equinovarus. Karyotype was 46,XY. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showed normal-sized adrenals. The patient's twin, a phenotypic female, had died at age 2.5 years after an unknown illness presenting with weakness and cyanosis.
Sahakitrungruang et al. (2011) described 2 sibs with hormonal findings suggesting nonclassic lipoid CAH who had mutations in P450scc that retained partial function. A 46,XY male presented with underdeveloped genitalia and partial adrenal insufficiency; his 46,XX sister presented with adrenal insufficiency. Both sibs had small adrenals with calcifications.
Sahakitrungruang et al. (2011) noted that most cases of P450scc deficiency reported to that time had presented with the hormonal and phenotypic features of classic lipoid CAH, although none had been described with the massive adrenal enlargement typical of lipoid CAH. Patients with the 'classic' forms of both P450scc deficiency and lipoid CAH typically present with adrenal failure and salt wasting in infancy and are phenotypically female irrespective of genetic sex. The nonclassic forms of the disorders present with varying degrees of retained adrenal function and sexual development.



TOP3A
**Microcephaly, growth restriction, and increased sister chromatid exchange 2, 618097 (3), AR**
MGRISCE2 is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intrauterine growth restriction, poor postnatal growth with short stature and microcephaly, and increased sister chromatid exchange on cell studies. The disorder results from defective DNA decatenation. The pathogenesis of the disorder is similar to that of Bloom syndrome (BLM; 210900), but patients with mutations in the TOP3A gene do not have a malar rash (summary by Martin et al., 2018).
For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of MGRISCE, see Bloom syndrome (BLM; MGRISCE1; 210900)
Martin et al. (2018) reported 10 patients from 7 unrelated families with growth failure. The patients, who ranged in age from 5 months to 15 years, had intrauterine growth retardation, low birth growth parameters, and poor postnatal growth (weight between -2.7 and -7.5 SD, height between -2.7 to -5.8 SD), as well as microcephaly -2.3 to -5.7 SD. Multiple cafe-au-lait patches were observed in some patients, but none had a malar rash. Several patients had dilated cardiomyopathy, including 2 who died of the heart disease. Additional less common features included mild developmental delay (4 patients), decreased subcutaneous fat (3 patients), recurrent infections (3 patients), and gastroesophageal reflux (2 patients). Photographs of some of the patients provided in the article suggested dysmorphic facial features, including frontal bossing and progeroid features in some. Skeletal muscle biopsy from 1 patient showed 87% mitochondrial DNA depletion; this measurement was not available from the other patients. None of the patients had malignancies, but Martin et al. (2018) noted that they were still young at the time of report.
**?Progressive external ophthalmoplegia with mitochondrial DNA deletions, autosomal recessive 5, 618098 (3), AR**
Nicholls et al. (2018) reported a 67-year-old woman who presented with slowly progressive ptosis, intermittent double vision, mild dysphagia and nasal regurgitation, and sensorineural hearing loss. Additional features included rapid cycling mood disorder, cardiac arrhythmias necessitating a pacemaker, exercise intolerance, and cerebellar ataxia. Physical examination was consistent with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and other findings included dysarthria, proximal limb and neck muscle weakness, upper limb dysmetria, and broad-based gait. Nerve conduction studies showed a mild sensory neuropathy, and brain imaging showed cerebellar atrophy and symmetric changes in the thalami and midbrain. Echocardiogram showed impaired left ventricular function, ectopic beats, and tachycardia. Patient skeletal muscle biopsy showed numerous COX-deficient ragged-red fibers, increased mtDNA deletions (over 80%), and extensive variable mtDNA rearrangements.



MYO18B
**Klippel-Feil syndrome 4, autosomal recessive, with myopathy and facial dysmorphism, 616549 (3), AR**
Klippel-Feil syndrome-4 with nemaline myopathy and facial dysmorphism is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized mainly by severe hypotonia apparent from infancy. Klippel-Feil anomaly is primarily defined by fusion of the cervical spine, with associated low posterior hairline and limited neck mobility being observed in about half of patients (summary by Alazami et al., 2015).
For a general description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of Klippel-Feil syndrome, see KFS1 (118100).
Alazami et al. (2015) studied an unrelated Saudi boy and girl with Klippel-Feil syndrome who also exhibited myopathy, mild short stature, microcephaly, and distinctive facies. The 14-year-old boy, born of consanguineous parents, presented at 16 months of age with motor delay and short stature, at which time microcephaly was also noted. He was floppy in infancy, sat at age 1 year, and walked at 2 years. Examination at 12.5 years of age revealed central and peripheral hypotonia and +4 muscle power (reduced resistance). Since childhood, his gait had been clumsy with frequent falls. Brain MRI was normal, but electromyography was suggestive of myopathy. Muscle biopsy showed mild to focally moderate variation in myofiber size, with atrophic and hypertrophic fibers. Ultrastructural examination showed diffuse myofibrillar disarray with prominent loss or disruption of myosin filaments. Focally, some fibers showed subsarcolemmal accumulation of globular deposits of electron-dense material, reminiscent of nemaline rods, and there was loss of normal banding due to loss of thick myosin filaments. The 12-year-old Saudi girl, born of first-cousin parents, had poor motor function in infancy but attained standing and walking at appropriate ages. Mild muscle weakness was present on examination, but no muscle biopsy was done. Both patients exhibited dysmorphic features including short webbed neck, low posterior hairline, bilateral ptosis, and bulbous nose with hypoplastic alae nasi. X-ray revealed fusion of the cervical spine in both, and the girl also had dextroconvex thoracolumbar scoliosis and bilateral acetabular dysplasia.
Clinical Variability
Malfatti et al. (2015) reported a female infant, born of consanguineous Portuguese parents, with severe nemaline myopathy and fatal cardiomyopathy. Prenatal ultrasound at 22 weeks' gestation showed reduced left ventricle and aortic valve growth. After birth, the infant showed hypotonia with reduced spontaneous movements, tendon contractures, and poor feeding. She also had dysmorphic features, including transversal enlargement of the skull, small and horizontal palpebral fissures, high-arched palate, low-set ears, pectus excavatum, large and low implanted thumbs, and clinodactyly. Cardiac abnormalities included hypertrophic left cavities, interatrial communication, and pulmonary hypertension. She had hemodynamic instability and poor respiratory status, resulting in death at age 4.5 months. Muscle biopsy showed marked fiber size variability and atrophic fibers with rare centralized nuclei. Small nemaline bodies were found in about 40% of fibers. Postmortem examination was not performed. Malfatti et al. (2015) noted that Klippel-Feil syndrome was diagnosed during childhood in the patients reported by Alazami et al. (2015), whereas their Portuguese patient died at 4.5 months of age; radiographs were not performed on the patient reported by Malfatti et al. (2015). Malfatti et al. (2015) suggested that the cardiomyopathy observed in this patient may be variant-specific, since a truncated MYO18B protein was detected in muscle samples from the infant; this may have caused a toxic effect as opposed to complete loss of MYO18B that was found in the patients reported by Alazami et al. (2015). Mutations in major nemaline myopathy genes had been excluded in the patient reported by Malfatti et al. (2015); she was 1 of 34 patients with mild nemaline myopathy and 17 with severe nemaline myopathy who underwent exome sequencing.



SYP
**Mental retardation, X-linked 96, 300802 (3), XLR**
Tarpey et al. (2009) identified 4 families with X-linked mental retardation who had mutations in the SYP gene. In 3 families, all with truncating mutations, mental retardation was mild to moderate and there were no consistent additional features, although epilepsy was noted in some individuals. Female carriers had no manifestations.



CUX1
**Global developmental delay with or without impaired intellectual development, 618330 (3), AD**
Platzer et al. (2018) reported 9 individuals, including a mother and 2 children, from 7 families with global developmental delay. All 9 had speech delay and 7 had motor delay. Clinical information provided for 8 individuals showed that 2 had moderate intellectual disability (ID) at ages 3 years and 5 years, and 3 had mild ID at ages 12 years, 12 years, and 32 years. Three had intelligence at normal ranges at ages 4, 6, and 8 years, with IQ testing available for 2 (IQ values of 82 and 95). No individuals showed signs of regression. Average age of unassisted walking was around 24 months, with a range of 16 to 42 months. Hypotonia was present in 3 individuals, with 1 using a wheelchair for distances over 100 meters at age 4 years. Two individuals had borderline short stature. Two individuals had patent ductus arteriosus and 2 had hypospadias. Four individuals had brain MRI, which showed no major abnormalities or malformations.
